 'The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced plans to immediately launch a new policy to force asylum-seeking migrants to wait in Mexico for their immigration court hearing. Officially labeled the “Migrant Protection Protocols” but more commonly known as “Remain in Mexico,” this sweeping change to how people access the asylum process could lead to catastrophic results.Asylum seekers along the southern border could be made to wait months or longer in Mexico despite the country’s increasing levels of violence and instability. For example, in 2018, the murder rate in Mexico increased by 33 percent over the previous year. Last December, two Honduran teenagers were brutally killed in Tijuana while staying at a migrant youth shelter.Apart from the danger migrants face, the details of how the policy will be implemented remain largely unclear—including how individuals waiting in Mexico will obtain access to U.S. attorneys trained in U.S. immigration and asylum law. It is also not certain when the policy will become active border-wide.Upon arrival those subject to the new plan will be returned to Mexico with a “Notice to Appear,” requiring them to return to the United States for an immigration court hearing at a later date.The process continues to be difficult from there. In order to actually find out the specified date of their hearing, they will need to dial into a toll-free U.S. number (which may or may not work from Mexico) and U.S. authorities will then bus them to a courthouse for their hearing. Court proceedings involve multiple hearings, but media reports indicate that the U.S. government intends for a first hearing to take place within 45 days and that proceedings would be completed within one year.Unaccompanied children and Mexican nationals will not be subject to the policy and other “vulnerable individuals” would be considered on a “case-by-case basis.” However, families with children could very well face return and a prolonged stay in Mexico.According to senior DHS officials, the plan will be piloted at the San Ysidro port of entry, adjacent to Tijuana, Mexico. The plan will start with the return of 20 migrants from Central America who all had temporary visas in Mexico.The San Ysidro border crossing is the busiest in the country and is already strained given the arrival of a migrant “caravan” of over 6,000 mostly-Honduran migrants in December. DHS has already been operating a “metering” system to queue and slowly process the asylum seekers that wait there and is being sued for turning away asylum seekers across the southern border.The policy was first unveiled in December by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a move many called unilateral. At that time, the Mexican government responded by announcing plans to issue humanitarian visas for asylum seekers to work and remain in Mexico while they await their hearing. There are still no details about whether any government or non-governmental entity would provide humanitarian aid and housing to potentially tens of thousands of migrants stranded there.One senior Mexican official stated:“If they return people that are vulnerable, that have a founded fear of persecution in Mexico, or people that require some special attention, we don’t have resources to address that.”Meanwhile, on Friday afternoon, the Mexican government shared in a press conference that the United States planned to return 20 migrants to Mexico every day, stating, “Mexico doesn’t agree with the move, but will accept the migrants.”Before this plan was announced, most migrants at the southern border were placed in an expedited removal process by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, and then taken into custody for a screening by an asylum officer to determine whether they had a fear of return to their home country. If so, they were scheduled for an asylum hearing before an immigration judge.Remain in Mexico is a dramatic and dangerous shift in U.S. immigration policy that will place asylum seekers at grave risk of harm. The Trump administration is creating yet another unnecessary crisis and offering up harmful solutions that benefit no one.Tags:  Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, featured, U.S.-Mexico BorderIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'I am an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Kentucky, and the 2016-17 Central American Visiting Scholar of the\xa0David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS) at Harvard University.\xa0In the spring and fall semesters of 2019, I will be a visiting scholar at\xa0the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.\xa0My field of specialization is comparative politics, with a focus on public opinion and political behavior in Latin America.My research program focuses on the political impacts of inequality and marginalization. More specifically, my research agenda integrates topics related to economic inequality, gender inequality, crime and violence, and international migration. Broadly defined, my research examines three main research questions: 1)\xa0How do contexts characterized by economic marginalization and violence affect disadvantaged citizens’ political behavior?\xa02)\xa0What are the political consequences of strategies disadvantaged citizens adopt to cope with economic marginalization and violence? 3)\xa0What role does the state play in reducing political inequality? To explore these questions, I employ experimental and non-experimental research designs as well as advanced statistical methods, including multilevel modeling, multilevel path analysis, and causal inference techniques.I am a member of the editorial board of two peer-reviewed journals, Political Behavior and\xa0Revista Latinoamericana de Opinión Pública.At the University of Kentucky, I teach graduate seminars on Comparative Political Behavior (PS711) and Comparative Politics (PS620). At the undergraduate level, I teach courses on Latin American Politics (PS428) and Global Inequality (PS492).\xa0For more information about my research and teaching visit my personal website: abbycordova.com\xa0Ongoing Book ProjectsCórdova, Abby.\xa0Violence against Women and Political Participation in Contexts of Criminal ViolenceAbstract: Across the developing world, unprecedented levels of criminal violence led by non-state armed groups have coincided with alarming rates of violence against women (VAW). In this book project, I develop a theoretical framework that helps explain how non-state armed groups’ territorial control make women more vulnerable to gendered violence and its consequences for women’s political participation. I argue that criminal groups’ territorial control increases women’s vulnerability to gendered violence in and outside the home, which undermines women’s likelihood of engaging in politics. I test my hypotheses in the context of gang’s territorial control in El Salvador, relying on quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative analyses use data from two large-scale original surveys at the neighborhood level and a nationally representative survey of VAW. These data allow me to employ survey experiments and advanced statistical techniques to systematically examine the links between gangs’ territorial control, VAW, and women’s political participation.Córdova, Abby, and Annabella España. Making Decentralization Work for Women: The Electability and Representation of Women in Local Governments.Abstract: The third wave of democratization resulted in greater autonomy and more responsibilities for local governments in the developing world. One of the expectations was that decentralization reforms would bring opportunities to improve the political representation of historically marginalized populations, including women. In this book project, we seek to identify the challenges that Latin American women still face to be elected to office and influence public policy at the local level. We argue that the prevalence of gender stereotypes undermines women’s representation in local governments, particularly when women are members of an opposition party. To test our theory, we rely on qualitative and quantitative data. More specifically, we will use data from an original multi-year elite survey carried out among 1000 elected council members across 101 municipalities in El Salvador, in-depth interviews with party leaders and council members, content analysis of council meetings, and electoral data from more than 5,000 municipalities across 22 Latin American countries.Peer Reviewed ArticlesCórdova, Abby. 2019. “Living in Gang-Controlled Neighborhoods: Impacts on Electoral and Non-Electoral Participation in El Salvador.” Latin American Research Review (Scheduled for publication, March of 2019).Paper presented at the 2017 Latin American Studies Association (LASA) conference in a featured panel co-sponsored by the Latin American Research Review and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.Abstract: Gangs’ territorial control affects the lives of residents in thousands of neighborhoods across Latin America. In Northern Central American countries in particular, gang control over entire neighborhoods is a widespread phenomenon. I argue that gang dominance constrains the ability of neighborhood residents to mobilize politically, and consequently resist gang violence through institutionalized channels. Living in gang controlled neighborhoods results in fewer incentives and opportunities to make political elites accountable for one’s personal safety. Even residents who have already experienced crime first hand are discouraged from turning to politics as a strategy to change the status quo. My theoretical insights identify mechanisms through which gangs’ neighborhood control affects non-electoral and electoral participation. To test my hypotheses, I rely on census and public opinion data collected in 71 neighborhoods in El Salvador. I estimate a series of multilevel models to explore how the extent of gang dominance in neighborhoods conditions the political participation of crime victims and non-victims. As such, this article offers the first systematic statistical analysis of the effect of gangs’ territorial control on political participation in the Latin American context. The findings suggest that living under gang rule undermines residents’ right to engage freely in politics in nuanced ways.\xa0Hiskey, Jonathan, Abby Córdova, Mary Malone, and Diana Orcés. 2018. “Leaving the Devil You Know: Crime Victimization, U.S. Deterrence Policy, and the Emigration Decision in Central America.” Latin American Research Review 53(3), 429–447.Featured in Panoramas and cited by the Wall Street Journal, among other media outlets. Within the first two weeks this article was published, it has been viewed online over 380 times and downloaded more than 100 times.Abstract: Following a sharp increase in the number of border arrivals from the violence-torn countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras in the spring and summer of 2014, the United States quickly implemented a strategy designed to prevent such surges by enhancing its detention and deportation efforts. In this article, we examine the emigration decision for citizens living in the high-crime contexts of northern Central America. First, through analysis of survey data across Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, we explore the role crime victimization plays in leading residents of these countries to consider emigration. Next, using survey data collected across twelve municipalities in Honduras, we evaluate the extent to which knowledge of heightened US immigration deterrence efforts influenced respondents’ emigration decision. Though a vast majority of these respondents were aware of the stricter US immigration policy regime, this awareness had no effect on their consideration of emigration as a viable strategy.Córdova, Abby. 2018. “The Effect of Gang Activity on Trust in Government: Evidence from El Salvador.” América Latina Hoy published by the University of Salamanca, Spain.Córdova, Abby and Gabriela Rangel. 2017. "Addressing the Gender Gap:\xa0The Effect of Compulsory Voting on Women’s Political Engagement."\xa0Comparative Political Studies 50(2): 171-199.Abstract: In light of gender disparities in political involvement, extant research has examined mechanisms for incorporating ordinary women into politics. We complement this literature by exploring the effect of an overlooked institution theorized to promote political equality by maximizing voter turnout: compulsory voting. We theorize that in enforced compulsory voting systems women are more likely to receive and seek information about electoral choices than their counterparts in voluntary voting systems. Consequently, compulsory voting helps narrow the gender gap beyond voting by creating opportunities and motivations for women to engage with the electoral process and its main actors. Our multilevel analysis based on cross-national survey data lends strong support to our hypotheses. Countries with enforced mandatory voting laws display a much smaller gender gap not only in voting, but also in several other forms of electoral engagement, including political party information, campaign attentiveness, party attachment, and campaign participation. \xa0\xa0Barnes, Tiffany and Abby Córdova (equal author contribution). 2016.

Journal of Politics 78(3): 670-686.\xa0Winner of the Midwest Political Science Association\'s 2017 Sophonisba Breckinridge Award for best paper on women and politics.Abstract: Gender quotas have been adopted in over a hundred countries in an effort to address gender disparities in national legislatures. Yet, the determinants of citizen support for gender quota policies remain largely understudied. We develop a theory that emphasizes the impact of institutional performance and political values to explain citizen support for gender quotas and how these two factors differentially influence men’s and women’s quota support. Based on data for 24 Latin American countries, we find that citizens in countries with relatively good governance quality who express a strong preference for government involvement to improve citizens’ wellbeing show the highest levels of quota support. Further, whereas good governance increases quota support at a higher rate among men than women, preferences for government involvement exert a stronger influence on women’s support for quotas. Consequently, good governance quality reduces the gender gap in quota support by substantially increasing men’s support for quotas.Córdova, Abby and Matthew Layton. 2016.\xa0“When Is ‘Delivering the Goods’ Not Good Enough? How Economic Disparities in Latin American Neighborhoods Shape Citizen Trust in Local Government.” World Politics 68(1): 74-110.Abstract: This article develops and tests a theory to explain why perceptions of good government performance are a necessary but insufficient condition for the poor to trust their local government. The authors theorize that independent of partisan sympathies, the poor evaluate local government on the basis of government performance and the economic disparities that they observe in their neighborhood of residence. Accordingly, even if the poor hold positive perceptions of government performance, they are less likely to trust their local government when they live in a context of high economic inequality. To test their theory, the authors rely on census, public opinion, and systematic observation data collected within resident-identified neighborhood borders in each of seventy-one neighborhoods sampled from six municipalities in El Salvador. The findings are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that economic inequality at the neighborhood level may produce a reservoir of distrust in local government among the poor. The results further highlight the political relevance of neighborhoods for the formation of citizen attitudes toward local government in the Latin American context.Córdova, Abby and Jonathan Hiskey. 2015. “Shaping Politics at Home: Cross-Border Social Ties and Local-Level Political Engagement.”\xa0Comparative Political Studies 48 (11): 1454-1487.Abstract: The dramatic rise of democratic regimes around the world has coincided with an equally significant increase in migration, characterized by an unprecedented movement of people from emerging to established democracies. Through analysis of survey data from six Latin American countries, we offer an empirical evaluation of theoretical mechanisms through which migration can shape the political behaviors of non-migrants in sending nations. We find that individuals who have strong cross-border ties that connect them with relatives living in the U.S. are more likely to participate in local politics, sympathize with a political party, and persuade others to vote for a party. Those effects are influenced by the positive impact of cross-border ties on civic community involvement, political interest, and political efficacy. Moreover, the evidence suggests that frequent usage of the Internet among non-migrants with strong cross-border ties results in increased political knowledge, which contributes to their greater political interest and efficacy.Córdova, Abby. 2011. “The Role of Social Capital in Citizen Support for Government Action to Reduce Economic Inequality.”\xa0Journal of International Sociology\xa041 (2): 28-50. (Special Issue on Political Inequality in Latin America)Abstracts: This article suggests that an important source of political conflict in Latin America and the Caribbean is the disagreement among the citizenry on the role of government in reducing economic inequality, particularly between the very rich and the poor. While the poor clamor for vigorous public policies to reduce economic inequality, the rich show significantly lower support. The findings of this article, however, indicate that social capital, in the form of interpersonal trust, does work as a conciliatory force between haves and have-nots. The results shed light on the importance of cultivating social capital in the region to boost support among the wealthy for public policies that favor the poor, and consequently for creating the political conditions for governments to fight economic inequality and, in turn, political disparities.Córdova, Abby and Mitchell A. Seligson. 2010. “Economic Shocks and Democratic Vulnerabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean.”\xa0Latin American Politics and Society\xa052 (2): 1-35.Abstract: Historical evidence suggests that bad economic times often mean bad times for democracy, but prior research has given us little guidance on how this process may work. What economic conditions are most threatening, and how might they weaken consolidating democracies? This article uses the AmericasBarometer conducted by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) to answer these questions by focusing on core attitudes for the consolidation of democracy. We use survey data at the level of the individual and economic data at the country level to help detect democratic vulnerabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The study finds that conditions of low levels of economic development, low economic growth, and high levels of income inequality increase those vulnerabilities substantially, but the effects are not uniform across individuals. Some groups, especially the young and the poor, are particularly vulnerable to some antidemocratic appeals.Córdova, Abby and Mitchell A. Seligson. 2010. “Governance and Support for Stable Democracy in Latin America: Results from the AmericasBarometer 2008.” Journal of Democracy en Español\xa02: 28-46.\xa0\xa0\xa0Abstract: The results of the AmericasBarometer surveys show that support for stable democracy in Latin America is strongly determined by the performance of the state. We find that, in addition to personal traits such as age and socio-economic status, factors related to democratic governance strongly influence citizens’ values theorized to be important for democratic stability. Experiences with crime and corruption and perceptions that democratic governments are not doing enough to improve citizens’ living conditions are undermining citizen support for democracy in many countries in the region.Córdova, Abby and Mitchell A. Seligson. 2009. “Economic Crisis and Democracy in Latin America.”\xa0PS: Political Science & Politics\xa0(4): 673-678.Abstract: While the world is focused on the economic impact of the financial and credit meltdown, what might be its impact on politics? In well-established democracies, probably not more than elections lost by incumbent parties seen as having mismanaged the economy. But what of consolidating democracies that predominate in the developing world, where some forecasts expect the crisis to hit the poor especially hard? This article uses AmericasBarometer survey data from Latin America and the Caribbean drawn on the eve of the crisis to project how it might affect democracy in the region.\xa0\xa0\xa0Measuring Community Resilience and Citizen Insecurity. 2014.

After graduating from Yale Law School, Chris worked for three years as a public defender in Louisville, Kentucky. He represented hundreds of clients in the adult trial division and was a member of the capital trial division for nearly two years. In 2000, Chris partnered with another former defender to form a small private law firm dedicated to criminal defense and civil rights litigation. He continued to represent those accused of crimes in Kentucky’s trial courts, and broadened his practice to include appellate, postconviction, and federal habeas corpus litigation on behalf of convicted prisoners. His firm brought civil rights actions and tried civil rights cases in both state and federal courts. In 2006, Chris became a Robert M. Cover Clinical Teaching Fellow at the Yale Law School, where he taught in numerous clinics, including the Capital Punishment Clinic, Criminal Defense Project, and the Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic. After serving as a Visiting Assistant Clinical Professor at the Suffolk University Law School during the 2009-10 academic year, where as a teacher of the Suffolk Defenders Clinic he supervised students defending criminal cases in the Boston Municipal Court system, Chris came to the Sturm College of Law to teach in the Criminal Defense Clinic.

 'Cyrus D. Mehta & Partners PLLC represents corporate and individual clients in complex and routine immigration law matters.\xa0 The firm has a growing group of extremely talented lawyers and support staff who work closely with clients in the areas of business immigration, labor certifications, removal defense, waivers, federal court litigation, citizenship, and related matters.\xa0\xa0The firm’s\xa0Managing Partner, Cyrus Mehta, is an internationally recognized immigration attorney who is regularly invited to speak on immigration subjects by bar associations, non-profits and universities.Unlike many other firms that tend to specialize in one aspect of immigration law,\xa0the firm\xa0is unique insofar that it has developed equal expertise in representing large corporations regarding their immigration needs as well as representing individuals in business and family immigration, citizenship, removal or asylum matters.\xa0 As a result of this broad expertise,\xa0the firm\xa0is able to provide comprehensive representation to a client in virtually every immigration-related matter.The firm\xa0is committed to providing exceptional services to its clients, often under complex and novel circumstances, \xa0whether the client is a corporation or an individual.\xa0 The firm’s well trained and dedicated staff, who speak several languages, will make every effort to provide the most optimum, ethical and creative solutions to meet each client’s objective.\xa0The firm\xa0has also often succeeded where other lawyers have failed.\xa0 Chambers USA 2017\xa0 has stated that the firm is “[r]enowned for its capacity to offer counsel on highly complex immigration cases. Recent work includes complex H-1B and L visa evidence requests and the termination of removal proceedings against clients.”\xa0 The 2017 guide has also quoted sources (mainly from clients) stating:“They were exceptional, they got us the visa in advance of the timeline. They were very responsive and handled pretty much everything with very little impact on me or my schedule.” “Their knowledge of immigration matters is excellent, they’re very prompt in responding and\xa0they are thorough in their work. They are understanding, and appreciate their clients.”Through the hundreds of articles on our website and blog, we also raise public awareness of immigration trends and assist people in their grassroots advocacy efforts.\xa0 In this regard, we continue to inform the public about contemporary issues of national importance, as well as advocate about the positive impact of immigrants in the United States.The firm’s attorneys are regularly invited to speak at legal seminars and conduct workshops for bar associations, non-profit organizations and universities. We also write articles for newspapers, online publications and appear on television. The media regularly seeks our views on immigration and related issues.\xa0The firm’s\xa0present and past attorneys hold and have held high-level positions in bar associations, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, American Immigration Council, New York City Bar, the New York City Bar Justice Center and other prestigious non-profit organizations.The firm\xa0has successfully litigated claims on behalf of non-citizens in immigration court, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), federal district courts and courts of appeal, often on novel issues and cases of first impression.\xa0 For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled favorably in a cancellation of removal case, Pareja v. Att’y Gen., 615 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2010).\xa0 We have also had success in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on asylum cases, as in Karijomenggolo v. Gonzales, 173 Fed. Appx. 34 (2d Cir. 2006). \xa0CDMA’s attorneys also provided amicus support in an important federal district court decision establishing a broader definition for equivalent foreign degrees in employment-based immigrant visa petitions, Grace Korean United Methodist Church v. Chertoff, 437 F. Supp. 2d 1174 (D. Or. 2005).\xa0 We have also had recent success at the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA), in Matter of Marlabs, Inc., 2013-PER-01125 (BALCA 2017), as well as in unpublished decisions of the BIA and AAO such as a 2017 BIA victory terminating removal proceedings and a 2015 AAO victory in a pro bono case regarding a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(i) of the INA.From the Chambers USA guideThe firm\xa0is deeply committed to representing clients on cutting edge immigration issues, often times on a pro bono basis. We were among the first to win gender-based asylum claims on behalf of women who were unable to seek protection from their abusive spouses from their home countries.\xa0The firm\xa0has conducted monthly pro bono clinics for a community-based organization, and has also supported the constituents of various non-profits in the area of immigration issues arising from domestic violence, persecution and HIV/AIDS.\xa0The firm\xa0has also assisted such organizations in obtaining visas for artists or their professional employees on a pro bono basis.\xa0The firm’s\xa0present and past attorneys have also been involved in leadership capacities with respect to finding ways to meet the unmet legal needs of the immigrant population.\xa0\xa0The firm’s\xa0attorneys have served as mentors for the Know Your Rights Project that provides pro bono advice to detainees whose cases are handled by the Varick Street, N.Y.

Cadava (Ph.D., Yale University, 2008) specializes in United States and Latin American history, with a focus Latinos in the United States and the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Originally from Tucson, Arizona, he came to Northwestern after finishing degrees at Yale University and Dartmouth College (B.A., 2000).Cadava is currently writing a book about the rise and fall of a conservative Hispanic movement between the 1960s and the 1990s. It is about the evolution of conservatism among Hispanics—the label they chose for themselves—from the establishment of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly through its fracture due to anti-immigrant policies such as California’s Proposition 187. Conservatism among Hispanics in the United States, the book will argue, was forged in the crucible of U.S.-Latin American relations, and what distinguishes Hispanic conservatism from mainstream American conservatism—what’s “Hispanic” about Hispanic conservatism, in other words—is the emphasis that Hispanics place on immigration and hemispheric economic, military, and cultural relationships.His first book Standing on Common Ground: The Making of a Sunbelt Borderland (Harvard University Press, hardcover in 2013, paperback in 2016) won the 2014 Frederick Jackson Turner Award from the Organization of American Historians, and was a finalist for the David J. Weber and Bill Clements Prize for the Best Non-fiction Book on Southwestern America. It addressed the shared cultural and commercial ties between Arizona and Sonora that show how the United States and Mexico have continued to shape one another despite their political and ethnic divisions. From the 1940s forward, a flourishing cross-border traffic developed in the Arizona-Sonora Sunbelt, as the migrations of entrepreneurs, tourists, shoppers, and students maintained a densely connected transnational corridor. Politicians on both sides worked to cultivate a common ground of free enterprise, spurring the growth of manufacturing, ranching, agriculture, and service industries. These modernizing forces, however, created conditions that marginalized the very workers who propped up the regional economy, and would eventually lead to the social and economic instability that has troubled the Arizona-Sonora borderland in recent times.These projects have received support from the Stanford Humanities Center; the Ford Foundation; the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation; Mellon Mays Graduate Initiatives Programs; and a Huggins-Quarles Prize from the Organization of American Historians.Cadava’s other research interests include the U.S.-Mexico border in all time periods; frontiers and borders around the world; memories of the U.S.-Mexico War; and the movement of art and artists between Mexico and the United States.His writing has appeared in The Journal of American History, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic online, the San Francisco Chronicle online, the Arizona Daily Star, and in the publications of the Immigration Policy Center, the National Park Service, and the American Historical Association.Cadava teaches undergraduate and graduate courses—both lectures and seminars—on Latino History, North American Borderlands, Comparative World Borders, the American West, and social, cultural, and political histories of the United States and Latin America.',

 'This week Congress passed a $1.3 trillion bill to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year, running through September 30, 2018. Though the legislation includes record levels of immigration enforcement, detention beds, and additional funds related to a border wall, the bill failed to provide President Trump with the funds to spend as he saw fit or a solution for Dreamers. These missing pieces prompted a short-lived veto threat from the president, who signed the bill anyway hours before a shutdown.In the 2,000-page bill, Congress agreed to provide $1.6 billion dollars for a border wall, but were specific about how the Department of Homeland Security could spend the money.The funds allow for 33 miles of new fencing to be built in Texas, but bar new types of border structures—including the “see-through” and concrete fencing the president prefers. The bill also includes funds for 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego and about 45 miles of replacement fencing along the southwest border.No funding will be allocated for additional Border Patrol agents, despite the president’s pledge to hire 5,000 additional agents in his January 2017 executive order.In addition to the funds for border enforcement, the bill provides a financial boost to interior enforcement measures.Immigration and Customs Enforcement will receive a record $7 billion budget, which includes funds to maintain a daily average of 40,354 beds in immigration detention centers. This number is a new high and significantly above the 34,000 beds funded in recent years, but still well below the 51,379 beds the president had requested.ICE also received funds for 65 additional Homeland Security Investigations and 60 more ICE attorneys but did not receive any funds for additional front-line officers. As part of the January 2017 executive order, the president had promised to hire 10,000 additional officers.The bill does include important oversight and accountability measures requiring ICE to report weekly on the number of immigrants in detention, as well as language to reinforce the sensitive locations policy, which restricts enforcement at certain locations like schools, churches, and hospitals. Additionally, ICE will be required to reinforce policies that safeguard against family separation.Funding for immigration courts, which are run by the Department of Justice, also received a significant increase of $65 million to fund the hiring of an additional 100 immigration judge teams in an attempt to address the record-level backlog of immigration cases, which currently stands at over 665,000 cases.There were also last ditch attempts to attach a permanent solution for Dreamers into the bill, with Democrats reportedly offering $25 billion for the border wall in exchange for the Dream Act. However, this was rejected by the White House and Republicans who were only willing to offer two and half years of temporary protections for those who currently benefit under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, which Democrats rejected.The omnibus spending bill likely represents the last, must-pass bill in Congress before the midterm elections in November. This means Congress and the president all failed in their pledges to protect and find a permanent solution for Dreamers. Instead, Congress chose to spend billions of dollars on immigration enforcement and detention while Dreamers are left with uncertainty.Tags:  Congress, Donald Trump, featured, federal government spending on immigrationIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has entered the 2016 presidential race with the campaign slogan “defeat the Washington machine.” Yet his views and past legislative actions on immigration show that he is more likely to maintain the status quo of leaving reform in limbo rather than push forward meaningful reforms that harness the skills and talents immigrants bring to the U.S. Despite Sen. Paul’s public statements that the GOP needs to “welcome” immigrants, Sen. Paul’s actions during his first-term in congress highlight how he would rather put his energy behind enforcement measures than backing realistic, sensible policies to improve the well-being of all immigrants.Here are four things we know about Sen. Paul’s views on immigration:1. Sen. Paul wants to end President Obama’s Immigration Action.\n\nIn December 2013, the House of Representatives approved a bill filed by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) that would block President Obama’s executive action on immigration. Sen. Paul introduced companion legislation in the Senate because he believes that “our Constitution is being violated by this executive order and other actions by the Obama Administration to govern by executive fiat.” More than a hundred legal scholars disagree with Sen. Paul,\xa0noting that deferring deportation for up to 4 million immigrants is well within the President’s executive authority.Sen. Paul expressed his concerns with the President’s immigration action and also compared\xa0them to the Japanese internment camps during World War II at a Kentucky Association of Counties conference:“Think of what happened in World War II where they made the decision. The president issued an executive order. He said to Japanese people, ‘We’re going to put you in a camp. We’re going to take away all your rights and liberties and we’re going to intern you in a camp.’ We shouldn’t allow that much power to gravitate to one individual.”2. Sen. Paul voted against the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill.Sen. Paul voted against the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill S. 744 passed by the Senate because it did not include the completion of a border fence in 5 years or include a national identification card for U.S. citizen. He tried to pass his “Trust but Verify ” amendment with S. 744, which would include implementing these enforcement measures. This amendment was rejected by the Senate.\n\n3. Sen. Paul wants costly enforcement-first measures implemented before fixing our immigration system.On his campaign website, Sen. Paul says in a video that “millions of illegal immigrants are crossing our border without our knowledge and causing a clear threat to our national security” and continues to advocate for a border fence stretching the 1,969 mile U.S.-Mexico border before action on comprehensive immigration reform can move forward. Sen. Paul’s stance is more of the same enforcement-first policies that have been held over the past three decades, which have cost taxpayers $186.8 billion.Sen. Paul’s aggressive plan to put border-enforcement first is not new. When he ran for the Senate in 2010, his campaign website stated:“My plans include an underground electric fence, with helicopter stations to respond quickly to breaches of the border. Instead of closing military bases at home and renting space in Europe, I am open to the construction of bases to protect our border.”4. Sen. Paul introduced legislation to end birthright citizenship.In June 2011, Sen. Paul introduced a bill with Senator David Vitter (R-LA) that would amend the Constitution to end birthright citizenship because “citizenship is a privilege, and only those who respect our immigration laws should be allowed to enjoy its benefits.” This piece of legislation is particularly troublesome because, as a report by the American Immigration Council notes, ending birthright citizenship would create a new permanent underclass and enforces the myth that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. just to give birth. While the bill was never brought to a vote, the introduction of this bill shows that Sen. Paul is more interested in reinforcing immigration myths that distract us from finding solutions\xa0to the\xa0problems facing our outdated immigration system.Photo by Gage Skidmore.Tags:  Birthright Citizenship, Election 2016, enforcement, executive action, featured, Rand Paul, RepublicansIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Thousands of migrant children are currently being held at a tent city in Tornillo, Texas along the U.S.-Mexico border. Most of the children traveled alone in order to flee from violence in their Central American home countries and to reunite with family members already in the United States.An investigation released this week by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the facility was not conducting required FBI fingerprint checks of the 1,300 staff members tasked with caring for detained migrant children.Because the Tornillo tent city is not licensed by the State of Texas, the government claimed that the State did not conduct FBI fingerprint checks on staff. Instead, Tornillo had been using a private vendor to perform other, far less robust background checks. This included name-based searches of its staff members, which have been known to produce false positive and negative results on applicants.The inspector general found that other basic security standards were not being met at the facility (overseen by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement or ORR), leaving children at risk of neglect, abuse, and poor medical care. While awaiting sponsorship in the United States, children interact daily with the facility’s “direct care” workers, placing them at greater risk of mistreatment.In addition to the waived fingerprint requirement, ORR was not complying with other required standards. This included:The CA/N check determines whether a worker has a record of mistreating children. ORR requires care provider facilities to complete the check by looking at the last five years of a child care worker’s history.In the case of the Tornillo facility, no direct care workers had received the CA/N check. It had been waived because of how quickly the government claimed it needed to open the facility.ORR requires that one staff member must be on duty for every eight children during waking hours, and one for every 16 children during sleeping hours. Similar staffing minimums are required for case managers and clinicians.The inspector general found that there was a disproportionately higher number of children to clinicians at the facility.In particular, the inspector general was concerned that there was not enough staff trained to deal with children’s mental health, particularly for a group that likely experienced significant trauma in their home country or along their journey to the United States. The report found that there was only one mental health clinician for every 100 children on-site.Children have also been staying at the tent city for longer periods of time since it opened in June—the average length of stay has shot up from 20 days to 27 as of early October. The inspector general worried that this upward trend indicated that Tornillo was functioning more like a shelter, as opposed to its “initial design as an emergency short-term-care facility.” The original facility was only intended to be open for 30 days.Many of the children have, ironically, remained detained in the tent city due to background checks. The Trump administration began requiring stricter checks on potential adult sponsors for migrant children, leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest many sponsors. As a result, would-be sponsors have been too afraid to come forward, as they may be undocumented themselves.In the eight-page report, the inspector general concluded that these issues “warrant immediate attention because they pose substantial risks to children receiving care at this facility.” The OIG has given the facility no more than 30 days to address and fix these issues.It’s important to remember that these are children—they should be in facilities with childcare licenses, in foster housing, or with family members that can sponsor them.One 17-year-old boy from Honduras who had been detained at the tent city and was recently released to his family stressed this, saying “I feel so bad for the kids who are still there. What if they have to spend Christmas there? They need a hug, and nobody is allowed to hug there.”Photo by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\xa0Tags:  featured, Office of Inspector General, Office of Refugee Resettlement, Texas, unaccompanied childrenIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'In early October, a federal court ruled that the Trump administration had violated the law when it terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for individuals from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan. After weeks of negotiation with the ACLU, which brought the lawsuit, the government has now come forward with a plan to put that decision in action while the case is on appeal. The government’s plan, published Tuesday night, provides crucial breathing room for TPS holders whose status was set to expire soon.Under the government’s plan, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will draft a formal extension of TPS protections for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador and Nicaragua. The government has promised that this extension will “remain in effect so long as the Court’s order remains in effect.”In the short term, USCIS will automatically extend all work permits currently issued to TPS recipients from Sudan and Nicaragua for a six-month period ending on April 2, 2019. Both Sudan and Nicaragua’s TPS designations were set to end before that date; Sudan on November 2, 2018, and Nicaragua on January 5, 2019.Because the TPS designations for El Salvador and Haiti are not set to expire until mid to late 2019, USCIS will not yet take any actions to extend work authorization for those countries. However, if the court’s order is not “reversed or invalidated” before April 2, 2019, then USCIS will automatically extend benefits for TPS-holders from all four countries until at least January 2, 2020. Further extensions would then be made if necessary.The government’s plan also provides some measure of protection for TPS holders if the lower court’s order is reversed on appeal. In that situation, TPS holders from countries where the TPS designation has already expired will be given an “orderly transition period” of four months. However, if the court’s order is reversed before TPS expires for a specific country, then the agency will use the original expiration date.Almost immediately after the lower court’s order, the government filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Should the order be upheld by the Ninth Circuit, the government would likely appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Given the timing, it’s unlikely that the Supreme Court would be able to hear the case until the fall of 2019.Because the ACLU’s lawsuit was filed before the Trump administration ended TPS for Honduras and Nepal, individuals from those countries are still at risk of losing legal status. As the recent caravan has shown, Honduras is still a country suffering from substantial instability, despite the administration’s decision to end TPS for that country.Over the next year, as Congress debates the fate of individuals with TPS, it should keep in mind that hundreds of thousands of TPS holders deserve protection and the right to remain here in the country that they’ve made their home.Tags:  El Salvador, featured, Haiti, Ninth CircuitIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) drastically expanded its network of immigration jails in the last month by a startling 7 percent. ICE now holds about 48,000 individuals in its jails and private prisons, even though Congress has only appropriated funds for them to detain 40,500 individuals on any given day.How can a government agency overspend at such an alarming rate?ICE’s budget has been set at its current level since December 2017, when Congress agreed to a continuing resolution for Fiscal Year 2018. As it stands, ICE is overspending its appropriate budget by jailing 7,500 more people every day than Congress’s last appropriated spending levels allow.Due to overspending on the part of ICE, the Trump administration diverted nearly $10 million in funding to them from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in September 2018. The costly expansion is particularly troubling given the fact that it took place during the recent government shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history and cost the economy $11 billion.The increase in ICE detention reflects a bump of one billion dollars in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s appropriation budget for immigration detention and enforcement, from $3.212 billion in fiscal year 2016 to $4.110 billion in fiscal year 2018.This is not the first time that ICE overspent what Congress has appropriated, then sought to take funds away from other agencies providing vital services.For the past three years, ICE has systematically manipulated the appropriations process to achieve its objective of expanding detention and enforcement. After overspending its budget, ICE then looks for money from other DHS agencies. ICE then uses the inflated budget as a starting point to begin negotiating the next year’s budget. In this way, the number of immigration beds—and ICE’s budget—will only continue to increase.As congressional negotiators begin the post-shutdown debate over the 2019 budget, the parties have approached ICE’s overspending from very different angles. Republicans are pushing for the budget proposed by President Trump, which would increase ICE detention beds to 52,000. On the other hand, Democrats have proposed cutting ICE detention capacity, expanding access to alternatives to detention, and increasing ICE oversight.ICE has a horrifying track record of care for those they hold in detention. Immigrants are increasingly held in facilities operated by massive and powerful private prison companies such as CoreCivic and GEO, both of which have long histories of cutting corners in order to increase their profit margin. Many are held in remote areas, far from loved ones and metropolitan areas in which they might find access to pro bono legal services or experts that may help them fight their case. Access to medical and mental health care is very limited, exemplified by the 22 immigrants who have died in ICE custody in just the past two years.The availability of alternatives to detention (ATDs) renders the boom of immigration detention even more absurd. ATDs are as effective, yet far more humane and less costly. The most commonly used ATD, the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, costs only $4.04 per day. The government’s use of costly detention—at $130 per night for an adult and over $320 per night per family member—counters common sense when many of those who are detained have demonstrated that they are neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.ICE generally has full discretion to release detained individuals and permit them to continue fighting their cases in a non-detained setting but chooses to keep them locked up regardless. This not only costs the American taxpayers far more than it should, but the practice of locking up individuals who pose no threat to the nation is immoral.Tags:  Donald Trump, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'In a year marked by the Trump administration’s cruel attempts to deter asylum-seeking families from coming to the United States, the news that a child had died in immigration custody appears to be a tragic low. While the circumstances of the death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal\xa0is still being investigated, this tragedy came as no surprise to those who have been monitoring Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) dangerous disregard for the health and safety of people in their custody.When migrants are detained after crossing the southern border, they are often taken to a CBP short-term detention facility. These facilities are often called “iceboxes” (or “hieleras” in Spanish) by migrants because of their frigid conditions. Surveillance footage turned over by the U.S. government in Doe v. Johnson, a lawsuit brought against the Tucson Sector Border Patrol, shows just how bad these facilities can be. Mothers are forced to change diapers on trash-strewn floors and overcrowded cells are filled with shivering people sleeping on cold concrete floors while wrapped in Mylar blankets.At these facilities, the only medical screening most migrants receive is a cursory “Are you OK?” While many Border Patrol agents have emergency medical training, most agents are solely trained to call local emergency responders if someone appears ill or injured. In the Doe case, a federal judge found that the Tucson Sector Border Patrol’s “cursory” medical screening forms fell below CBP’s own standards and was not even used at all times.CBP’s failure to provide adequate medical care largely stems from a refusal to admit that the agency’s mission has shifted over the past decade. When most “iceboxes” were built, the vast majority of migrants were Mexican adult males who would be returned to Mexico within hours and did not require overnight detention. However, over the past decade the number of non-Mexicans and young children arriving at the border has steadily risen.Because asylum-seekers, unaccompanied children, and non-Mexicans cannot be immediately deported, they are instead held for days—at times weeks—in CBP custody before being transferred to another facility where they will be given the opportunity to apply for relief for removal or will be deported to their home countries by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Data disclosed as part of the Doe case shows that more than 50 percent of all migrants in the Tucson Sector were held at least overnight, with hundreds held for more than 72 hours. As more asylum-seeking families arrive at the border, these delays appear to be increasing. During the family separation crisis, one child was held in an “icebox” for 25 days, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s own internal watchdog.Nevertheless, CBP refuses to admit that it’s in the business of detention, which would require the agency to do what every jail in the country does as a matter of law: ensure that people arriving at its facilities are given a screening carried out by a qualified medical professional in a language the detainee understands or with the help of an interpreter. Without adequate medical screening, vulnerable individuals are at risk of death or serious injury.Last week’s death of a child is not even the first such preventable death this year. In May, Roxsana Hernandez died of dehydration and exhaustion in California. A transgender woman fleeing persecution in her home country, Hernandez asked for asylum at the San Ysidro port of entry in May. She spent almost a week in a CBP “icebox” with her health deteriorating, reportedly receiving no medical care despite severe diarrhea and vomiting. One day after she was transferred to ICE custody, she was rushed to the hospital. An independent autopsy later confirmed that she had died of preventable dehydration.As a nation, we must ensure that vulnerable migrants who come into our custody are properly screened by qualified medical professionals, not by overworked Border Patrol agents trying to process people as quickly as possible. As Congress debates a new budget over the next week and conducts oversight hearings in the coming year, it should take measures to ensure that preventable deaths like this become a thing of the past.Photo by the American Immigration CouncilTags:  Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security, Doe v.

 'Small and rural towns across America are increasingly faced with the opportunities and challenges that come with settling new immigrants. In nearly 3,000 rural American towns, the immigrant population grew by 130 percent since 1990. While immigrants are increasingly credited with bringing growth and stimulus to small town America, their arrival can also create tension and division.Building a cohesive community where newcomers are welcomed takes work but can be done, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The report tells the story of two towns: Lexington and Madison, Nebraska. Both communities enjoy thriving housing markets and schools, vibrant business districts, and sustainable population growth thanks to their openness to immigration.In many of Nebraska’s rural communities, a growing percentage of the adult population was born outside the United States. Nebraska’s demographic shifts largely began with the rise of the meatpacking industry in the 1980s, which attracted foreign-born labor. The arrival of immigrants helped offset the state’s population declines and meet the demand of the growing industry. In fact, CAP reports that 1 in 3 workers today in the U.S. meatpacking industry is foreign-born.However, dealing with the demands that a growing population can have on a town’s housing market and education system must be addressed.For example, housing shortages in Lexington sparked tensions, but a public and private partnership moved to help ease the pressure on the real estate market. City leaders and Tyson Foods came together to collaborate and build 900 new housing units (200 already completed) by 2030.To address language and culture challenges, both Lexington and Madison school districts increased their English as a second language programs and made parent engagement a priority. Their schools designed programs to ensure that a diverse student body not only succeeds but creates the next generation of community leaders.In fact, CAP reports that “Madison’s and Lexington’s high schools consistently boast graduation rates above the state average of 90 percent.”Successful integration in rural communities is possible but takes time. Challenges and successes of rural towns like Lexington and Madison paint a willingness by thoughtful leaders to keep their communities alive, and provide helpful guidance to other small rural communities.Tags:  Center for American Progress, featured, NebraskaIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Immigration will undoubtedly be a central issue during President Trump’s State of the Union address. However, it’s unlikely that any of the proposals the president advances will move us closer to a policy breakthrough. It’s more likely the president will propose ideas that make our immigration system less effective and do little to keep us safe.The Trump administration’s solutions on immigration have so far only created more problems at the southern border, in the immigration courts, and for our legal immigration system.The president has been insisting on $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, claiming that a physical barrier would prevent migrants from crossing into the United States without authorization.But building more fencing is costly and unnecessary. Extensive barriers on the border already exist. They have done little to impede illegal border crossings. A wall will also not stop drugs from being smuggled into the United States, as most come through legal ports of entry.Instead of a wall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents say additional border security technology would be more helpful. This includes drones, sensors for ports of entry, and other surveillance systems. Congressional Democrats offered more technology like this in recent negotiations on border security.The United States has a well-established asylum system. Yet the administration has repeatedly tried to dismantle that system and create deadly barriers for asylum seekers fleeing to the United States.The administration’s attacks on asylum have been wide-ranging. Asylum seekers have been illegally turned away at the border, separated from their families, and denied access to the asylum process. Some are being forced to wait for their court dates on the Mexico side of the border despite the well-known dangers. Changes to asylum law have also disqualified many from receiving protections.This puts vulnerable people in dangerous situations and curtails their access to counsel. The solution to this self-made problem is simple—Trump should allow people to access our established asylum system so they can be vetted for protection in a safe and timely way. To make this a reality, there must be meaningful oversight of CBP and their handling of asylum seekers at the border. We can also complement protection at the border by increasing refugee admissions from abroad.Under the current administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abandoned their pre-existing enforcement priorities. Instead of targeting immigrants who present a risk to public safety, the agency began arresting anyone in the United States without legal status.ICE arrested nearly a third more immigrants who had no criminal history in 2018 than in 2017. They have also placed more people who have resided in the United States for long periods of times in removal proceedings. More expansive enforcement has devastated communities, as deported parents often have no choice but to leave behind their U.S.-citizen children and local economies suffered after immigrant workers were arrested.A return to common-sense enforcement priorities would cause far less damage for families and communities and use limited resources more effectively.The administration is also cutting legal immigration. These cuts are hurting the United States’ standing as a global competitor and causing worker shortages across the nation.This has included changes to employment visas and policies that could bar foreign students and exchange visitors from coming to the United States. The administration even proposed a complete overhaul of the U.S. immigration system that would cut legal immigration in half.The United States needs to remain a welcoming place for foreign talent. Rather than finding ways to slash legal immigration, the president needs to embrace it so our country does not fall behind.President Trump’s harsh vision for immigration is increasingly out of step with what’s in the best interest of the nation. The state of the union would indeed be stronger if the president offered productive, bipartisan solutions that make America a more welcoming and prosperous country.Tags:  Customs and Border Protection, Donald Trump, featured, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, State of the UnionIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'A new report alleges that the Trump administration (and partially Obama administration) may have separated thousands more families than previously reported and also details how thousands of asylum seekers have been illegally turned away at the U.S.-Mexico border.Amnesty International released the report last Thursday which reveals that upwards of 1,000 more families than originally reported may have been separated over the past two years, possibly up to 8,000 families.In newly released statistics, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) informed Amnesty International that it had separated 6,022 “family units” between April 19, 2018 and August 15, 2018. Combined with 1,768 family units previously reported separated between October 2016 and February 2018, almost 8,000 family units have been separated in the last two years. As of late September, 2018, the government identified 2,654 children as having been separated from their parents. Amnesty’s reporting suggests that almost triple that number of children may have been taken from their parents.Importantly, because the government’s use of the term “family unit” can refer either to an entire family or to individual members of a family, it is possible that the nearly 8,000 “family units” is actually closer to 4,000 families in total. However, even that lower number would indicate that more than 1,000 more families were separated than has previously been reported.Amnesty’s report also identifies many families who were separated by the government despite legally presenting themselves at a port of entry requesting asylum. Despite the fact that it is legal to apply for asylum at a port of entry and therefore no family would have been separated for the purpose of prosecution, the report identifies multiple families who did everything lawfully and were separated regardless. One woman, Maria, had legal custody of her disabled 17-year-old son. Despite presenting CBP with that proof, her child was taken from her.The report also reveals how the Trump administration continues to illegally deny asylum seekers access to the asylum process.Beginning in 2016, advocates began to report that the government was illegally turning away asylum seekers at the borders. According to a lawsuit filed by the American Immigration Council in July 2017, CBP has systematically turned away asylum seekers who legally present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum. Through dozens of interviews with government officials and asylum seekers, Amnesty’s report confirms that this practice remains ongoing.Amnesty’s researchers traveled across the U.S.-Mexico border documenting behavior at different ports of entry. In California, they witnessed hundreds of asylum seekers forced to wait weeks on the Mexican side of the border before being allowed to apply for asylum. In Arizona, asylum seekers and their children were forced to sit outside in temperatures over 100 degrees for periods as long as two weeks. In Texas, some ports of entry closed completely to asylum seekers, while others refused to process more than six or seven individuals per day.As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General recently documented in a scathing report, these policies lead desperate asylum seekers to cross the border illegally; many were then arrested and subject to family separation.Taken together, the Amnesty report paints a picture of a government agency intent on using cruel and harsh tactics to punish and attempt to deter asylum seekers. Reports like these are critical for shedding light on the extent to which these practices have been used and to help ensure that DHS corrects course going forward.Tags:  family separation, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'In April 2018, the Trump administration officially rolled out its “zero tolerance” policy—a policy that has since been universally condemned for its cruel and unlawful practice of separating parents and children migrating to the United States. The policy has had widely documented traumatic and enduring effects on parents and their children.Immigration advocates filed six administrative complaints on Monday against the U.S. government, seeking monetary compensation for harms to these separated families. The complaints, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), involve six mothers who were forcibly separated from their children—ranging in ages from five to 12 years old.The facts asserted in these complaints echo the experiences of countless others. The mothers witnessed immigration officers forcibly taking their children from them without explanation. The separations occurred despite tears and pleas by the mothers and their children. One mother reports having her child taken on May 10, only to “mockingly” be wished “Happy Mother’s Day” by an immigration officer.The mothers were given no information regarding where their children would be taken, how to reach them, or what would happen to them. They signed papers they did not understand. Ultimately allowed to speak with their children by phone, the mothers had to figure out how to pay for the calls, and in some cases, struggled to find someone to arrange for the calls. When they were able to reach their children, the phone calls lasted mere minutes.The mothers in these 6 complaints all report widespread continuing psychological, emotional, and physical effects for themselves and their children: anxiety, fear, nightmares, insomnia, and anger. Children continue to grapple with the mistaken fear that their mothers will abandon them, born of the shock of their initial forced separation by the U.S. government.The long-term effects of these separations are immeasurable and likely yet to be seen. To date, the U.S. government has stated that the forced separations total more than 2,700. In some instances, parents were deported without their children and continue their fight to be reunited with them.The U.S. government must be held accountable for implementing a cruel policy that relied on tearing mothers and fathers apart from their children to discourage migration to the United States. In filing their claims, these mothers and children are raising their voices with the hope that no family will ever have to endure the pain and trauma that they experienced, and which they continue to fight every day to overcome.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, family separation, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Despite the fact that immigrants living in and arriving in the United States today are not exactly receiving a warm welcome by key government institutions, a recent poll by the Cato Institute shows that immigrants’ faith in America’s key political institutions is strong. In fact, stronger than that of the native-born.General attitudes among the U.S. public towards U.S. institutions have been in decline for many years. According to Gallup, strong faith in Congress has dropped to 11 percent in 2018, down from 30 percent in 2004. Americans who have “little faith” in the presidency has risen to 40 percent in 2018 from to 20 percent in 2004.The Cato survey shows that a significantly higher percentage of immigrants express a great deal of confidence in both of these American institutions. Congress does better among immigrants with a 16 percent approval rating, compared to 7 percent among the native-born. The office of the president also enjoys more faith from immigrants at 22 percent, compared to 13 percent among the foreign-born.Other findings show that immigrants and the native-born overwhelming agree (70 percent) with the statement “America is better than most other countries.”Asked if they are proud of America’s “fair and equal treatment of all groups in society,” responses are virtually the same between immigrants who are U.S. citizens and native-born Americans. However, a higher proportion of immigrants who aren’t U.S. citizens say they are proud America treats groups equally.Only 39 percent of immigrants agree with the statement “there are some things about America today that make me feel ashamed of America.” 69 percent of the native-born surveyed felt differently. These findings reveal that immigrants are even less critical of America than their native-born counterparts.Interestingly, a 2017 study from Democracy Fund Voice which surveyed Trump voters, reported that they “expressed positive views of immigrants’ work ethic, but have concerns that immigrants are no longer willing to learn English, feel patriotic, or assimilate into American culture.”This new CATO survey flies in the face of that thinking. It demonstrates immigrants’ pride towards America and its institutions, which should come as no surprise as they chose to live, work, and raise families here.Tags:  cato institute, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Each year, U.S. employers seeking highly skilled foreign professional workers submit petitions on the first business day of April to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the limited pool of H-1B nonimmigrant visa numbers available for the coming fiscal year, which are capped at 65,000 for new hires and 20,000 for those who graduate with a master’s or doctoral degree from a U.S. university that meets certain requirements. For more than ten years, employer demand has exceeded the H-1B numerical limits and over the past four years, USCIS has reached the caps within the first five business days in April.If USCIS determines at any time during the first five business days of the filing period that it has received more than enough petitions to meet the numerical limits, the agency uses a computer-generated random selection process (or “lottery”) to select a sufficient number of H-1B petitions to satisfy the limits. Petitions not selected are returned to the petitioning employers. However, the selection process is not at all transparent. In fact, according to Melissa Crow, Legal Director of the American Immigration Council, “when petitions are submitted to USCIS in April, it’s as if they disappear into a ‘black box.’”In order to pry open that box and let the American public and those most directly affected see how the lottery system works from start to finish, and to learn whether the system is operating fairly and all the available numbers are being used, the American Immigration Council and the American Immigration Lawyers Association have teamed up on a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and USCIS, seeking information about the government’s administration of the H-1B lottery.\xa0The lawsuit, filed last Friday, was brought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by\xa0the American Immigration Council and Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd.The lawsuit seeks to understand how the electronic selection process works, what the process is for accepting or rejecting a petition in the lottery, how USCIS determines how many petitions to select in the lottery, how USCIS decides it has enough petitions to meet the numerical limits for petition approvals, how USCIS keeps track of visa number usage, and if USCIS actually allocates all of the available visa numbers.The lawsuit challenges USCIS’s failure to properly respond to the Council’s FOIA request by withholding responsive records and failing to identify and conduct an adequate search for records that describe how USCIS tracks and counts unused H-1Bs for each fiscal year and takes into account such unused numbers. Because demand far exceeds the limited pool of H-1B visa numbers available in a fiscal year, the American public—and in particular, U.S. employers, foreign nationals seeking H-1Bs and immigration lawyers—have an interest in a system that fairly selects the petitions submitted and completely allocates the H-1B numbers.Photo by\xa0Brian Turner.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, featured, FOIA, H-1B, USCISIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is an important humanitarian protection for people who are in the United States when certain natural disasters or civil conflict strike their home countries, making it unsafe for them to return. Despite the fact that conditions in many of these countries have not improved since their nationals received TPS, the Trump administration recently announced that it is ending protection for several countries. If the people who lose TPS are deported, this could ultimately force hundreds of thousands of people to return to destabilized countries.A new lawsuit, however, could help some TPS holders who have especially strong connections to the United States qualify for permanent legal status in this country. Given the administration’s decision to terminate these protections, it is especially important that TPS holders have a fair opportunity to apply for another type of legal immigration status if they are eligible.The lawsuit asks the court to stop immigration officials from denying TPS holders’ applications based on a faulty interpretation of the law and was filed as a class action in New York. The plaintiffs are TPS holders who have applied to be lawful permanent residents based on close family relationships or their employment. They are represented by the American Immigration Council and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.When an immigrant applies to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States, he or she must meet a wide and rigorous set of eligibility criteria. One requirement is that the immigrant show that he or she has been “admitted and inspected” into the United States—essentially, that immigration officials reviewed and agreed to an immigrant’s request to be in the United States.As several courts have recognized, getting TPS counts as an admission and inspection under the immigration laws. However, in most parts of the country, immigration officials still refuse to acknowledge that TPS counts as the type of admission that allows someone to apply to become a lawful permanent resident. The new lawsuit challenges the immigration officials’ unlawful policy.It is increasingly urgent that courts fix this problem and make sure that TPS holders who are eligible get a fair shot at applying for a more secure, permanent immigration status. President Trump’s disdain for the TPS program is well documented. His administration has already decided to end TPS for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan, and decisions about whether to end TPS for several other countries are coming in the next few months. Tens of thousands of TPS holders are left in limbo and at risk of deportation once protection for their home countries ends.Deporting people who have long held TPS to still turbulent countries would be a disaster, not only for TPS holders themselves, but also for the U.S. communities where they have lived and thrived for years, and so we urgently need action to protect long-term TPS holders. Thursday’s lawsuit is a first step to ensuring that some of those put at risk get a fair opportunity to apply to stay in the United States.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, El Salvador, featured, Haiti, Moreno v.

 'The Trump administration began implementing a deeply troubling new policy on January 28, 2019, the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP). Under the MPP, the government prevents asylum seekers from entering the United States by forcing them to remain in Mexico pending their request for protection.Now, a new letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen expresses grave concern over this misguided new policy and lays out how the new program will have a catastrophic impact on the safety of asylum seekers.The letter urges Sec. Nielsen to immediately rescind the MPP announced by DHS on January 24, 2019 and so far only implemented in Tijuana, Mexico. The MPP represents possibly the most sweeping attack on asylum yet under the Trump administration. Though relatively few migrants have been returned to Mexico so far, the administration had threatened to expand the policy to El Paso just last week.The violence and instability that migrants face on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border is well-documented. Some regions of the U.S.-Mexico border are considered by the State Department to be among the most dangerous locations in the world. Tijuana—the Mexican city where the MPP has been implemented—was the site of 2,518 murders last year, a record high and nearly seven times the total in 2012.The new policy could potentially affect tens of thousands of people, including many vulnerable individuals and children. The letter draws from first-hand testimonies of ten asylum-seeking families who traveled through Mexico on their way to seeking protection in the United States. Their sworn declarations attest to the violence and harm—including rape, beatings, kidnappings, and ransom—they faced on the Mexican side of our southern border. Some of this harm occurred within miles of the border itself, in cities where asylum-seekers may be forced to wait under MPP.One woman was raped by a cartel member who threatened to murder her child and sell his organs if she resisted. Another mother was kidnapped and sold to cartels by corrupt Mexican police officers, after which her family was forced to pay an exorbitant ransom.The letter also draws from over 500 surveys completed by asylum-seeking mothers detained in a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The surveys describe the extensive harm the mothers and their children experienced and witnessed in Mexico before crossing the border. The survey data reveals that the MPP’s promise of a safe process flies in the face of the real dangers faced by asylum seekers in Mexico.The surveys produced alarming findings, including:The inaccurately-named “Migrant Protection Protocols” will do nothing to actually protect migrants; instead, they force asylum seekers at our southern border to wait in unquestionably precarious and dangerous circumstances like those experienced and recounted in the letter to Sec. Nielsen.The letter urges Sec. Nielsen to terminate the MPP immediately and ensure that asylum seekers are provided meaningful access to safe, timely, and fair adjudication of their requests for protection. Protection from within the United States could also be complemented by increased access to the U.S. Refugee Program from within the region, particularly for vulnerable populations and children.Unlike the MPP, these are solutions that would help protect American values of providing humanitarian protection without putting peoples’ lives in danger.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, featured, U.S.-Mexico BorderIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'New estimates of the undocumented population in the United States confirm a trend that has been apparent for several years: the number of people who become undocumented each year by overstaying their visa now greatly exceeds the number who entered with no visa at all. This suggests that our immigration laws—and our immigration-enforcement mechanisms in particular—are in dire need of updating.Many people likely overstay the visas they entered on to remain with family members, keep their jobs, live in relative safety, and enjoy a greater degree of political or social freedom than they are accustomed to back home. These are hardly nefarious reasons for wanting to stay. It is true that we must enforce our immigration laws, but we must not impose an unduly harsh penalty for an offense that is committed for such sympathetic reasons—particularly when our economy and society have proven so capable of absorbing these newcomers.The new estimates from the Center for Migration Studies (CMS) confirm several years-long trends. For instance, the number of undocumented immigrants in the country has fallen since 2010 (from 11.7 million that year to 10.7 million in 2017). The sharpest declines occurred among undocumented Mexican migrants (the number of whom fell by 1.3 million during the same period).At the same time, the number of Central American migrants crossing the border without inspection has increased markedly, as tens of thousands of women and children in particular flee violence in their home countries. Yet visa overstayers still account for most of the new undocumented immigrants that join the U.S. population each year. Most visa overstayers come from Mexico, India, China, Venezuela, and the Philippines.Obviously, these patterns indicate that the Trump administration’s high-cost border wall would do little to stop undocumented immigration given that most are now overstays. More than that, however, the prevalence of visa overstayers raises other policy-related questions.To begin with, evidence indicates that the overwhelming majority of immigrants in general, and undocumented immigrants in particular, are not criminals—and have never even committed a serious crime. And yet the punishment for overstaying their visas is to be barred from reentering the United States for a period of either three or ten years, depending on how long they’ve been “out of status.” Arguably, this is an example of punishment that exceeds the severity of simply overstaying a visa.These are individuals who are making a choice to stay with loved ones or to build better lives for themselves. They want to join U.S. society as productive members, even though they have consciously chosen to remain here beyond the expiration date of their visa.Is an offense of this nature really deserving of such a harsh penalty—a ban of up to ten years from returning to the United States? Wouldn’t it be better for everyone if more opportunities for permanent immigration were created rather than forcing so many people to make this kind of choice?This is an issue perhaps best approached from the standpoint of empathy. Imagine the situation were reversed and you found yourself in another country on a temporary visa, living among family members you hadn’t seen for years and maybe working in a job far better than any you could get back home. Eventually, the clock runs down on your visa and you’re left with a difficult choice: give up the family and job to go back to your old home, or stay in this new home even after your visa has expired.If empathy doesn’t appeal to you, then from a pragmatic viewpoint it would be far too costly to round up and deport every single person who has overstayed their visa. The impact on the U.S. economy would be devastating.Yes, remaining in the United States longer than you are authorized to stay is breaking the rules. But think of what motivates people to break those rules in the first place. Ask yourself what we accomplish by ejecting visa overstayers from the country, harshly punishing them for a relatively minor offense, and ripping them out of the U.S. economy.Tags:  Donald Trump, featured, VisasIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Earlier this month, the Trump administration officially closed the doors of a “tent city” holding over 2,800 immigrant children in Tornillo, Texas. The closure comes after months of public pressure and local organizing. However, any celebration is short-lived. Just days after Tornillo’s closure, the administration announced its plan to increase bed space in another juvenile tent city in Homestead, Florida.The tent city of Tornillo, about 35 miles from El Paso, Texas opened in November 2016. It later became a major point of controversy when it started being used to house an influx of unaccompanied minors and children who had been separated from their parents in the summer of 2018.Since it opened, the Tornillo tent city experienced major pushback from the local community due to its military barracks-style conditions, as well as its limited access to medical and mental health care and educational opportunities for the children detained there.Because Tornillo—and now Homestead—are classified as “emergency” or “influx” shelters, they skirt state child welfare guidelines. Although these sites are deemed “temporary,” the trauma and pain that the children suffer within these facilities is permanent. In “emergency” detention facilities, there are lower standards for staff vetting, training, youth education, and health, as they follow only a loose set of Health and Human Services guidelines.Despite Tornillo closing, the administration announced they expect to almost double their capacity at the Homestead, Florida facility from 1,350 children to 2,350.Tax payers can be expected to pay a great deal to fund Homestead, as was the case with the Tornillo facility. The Texas site cost taxpayers approximately $144 million, amounting to about $400 per day to detain a child. Given the documented high cost of running Tornillo, the Homestead facility will be another costly bill for the American public.The recent expansion of the Homestead facility represents this administration’s continued interest in increasing the detention rates at the peril of immigrant children, one of the most vulnerable populations in the U.S. immigration system today.Photo via ShutterStockTags:  Donald Trump, featured, unaccompanied childrenIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'As the partial government shutdown stretches on,\xa0many\xa0individuals, families, and businesses\xa0around the country are\xa0struggling.\xa0At the heart of the shutdown and budget standoff is President Trump’s\xa0promise\xa0to\xa0“build the wall.”\xa0Yet for many\xa0people and businesses along the border, this is the last thing they want.\xa0\xa0Ahead of President Trump’s visit to the U.S.-Mexico border last week, business owners and leaders spoke out against\xa0the president’s continued demand\xa0to build additional fencing along the border.\xa0Business leaders in San Diego say that\xa0President Trump\xa0hyper-focusing\xa0on the\xa0wall is bad for the local economy\xa0and\xa0also\xa0an ineffective\xa0way to\xa0use taxpayer\xa0money, in part because the wall itself and the construction process can make it harder for people to cross the border at legal ports.\xa0With an estimated\xa090,000 northbound\xa0daily crossings at the\xa0San Ysidro port of entry, it is vital that business\xa0employees,\xa0customers,\xa0and goods or services\xa0can cross the border smoothly and efficiently.\xa0Businesses and communities throughout the border region\xa0have long voiced concern about\xa0the\xa0border wall and militarization\xa0stifling cross-border\xa0commerce,\xa0literally creating barriers\xa0that cut into\xa0vital\xa0revenue and\xa0relationships.\xa0\xa0According to\xa0Karim\xa0Bouris, executive director of Business for Good San Diego,\xa0San Ysidro businesses\xa0lost upwards of $5 million\xa0in November\xa0when\xa0the\xa0government closed the busy\xa0border\xa0crossing\xa0for\xa0several hours\xa0to install\xa0additional security barriers.\xa0In Santa Cruz\xa0County, California,\xa0businesses near the\xa0Tumacácori\xa0National Historical Park\xa0suffered when there\xa0were\xa0fewer visitors and tourists\xa0coming to the park from the Mexican side.\xa0Fewer tourists and shoppers means less money for the city of Nogales in Arizona, which relies on its sales taxes to pay for important services like law enforcement and sanitation.\xa0In\xa0border towns like Nogales, thriving businesses that\xa0attract new and return customers\xa0are vital to the local economy.\xa0\xa0But\xa0it can be hard to\xa0do\xa0this when customers can’t get across the border—or don’t want to.\xa0City Councilmember Marcelino\xa0Varona\xa0told\xa0Arizona Public Media\xa0that because of new\xa0barbed wire fencing\xa0in Nogales, “the frontier here—the border—looks like a prison system instead of a community.”\xa0\xa0In addition to\xa0U.S.\xa0businesses relying on\xa0shoppers coming from the Mexican side of the border,\xa0increased military presence and border fortifications\xa0negatively impact\xa0Americans visiting Mexico.\xa0For\xa0example,\xa0the U.S. government recently\xa0purchased a\xa0public parking lot\xa0in Nogales\xa0close to the border.\xa0Rather than sitting in long car lines to cross the U.S.-Mexico\xa0border, U.S. residents have parked in the lot\xa0and gone through the pedestrian crossing into Mexico, which is often\xa0a more efficient way to cross\xa0for short\xa0trips.\xa0The lot is currently inaccessible. After the government bought it,\xa0they closed\xa0the lot\xa0to the public and started filling it with military equipment.\xa0Without access to the lot, border residents have to park further away or skip the trip altogether—meaning fewer\xa0dollars added to the local economy and ultimately less money for public services in Nogales.\xa0\xa0When it comes down to it, border businesses and residents have been dealing with the presence of military personnel, equipment, physical barriers,\xa0and yes—a wall—for years.

 'Immigration restrictionists have often repeated a bold and erroneous claim: that there is a serious problem of asylum seekers who come to the U.S. border and disappear once released from detention. But both fact-checkers and independent studies show this is not true. In reality, the vast majority of asylum seekers diligently attend all of their immigration court hearings.Given that studies consistently show a high appearance rate for asylum seekers, why do some people keep getting this wrong? Boiled down to its simplest answer: the only government measurement on failures to appear in court has been unreliable for years.If an immigrant fails to appear for a scheduled immigration court hearing, they may be issued an order of removal “in absentia” (or “while absent”). Each year, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) reports the total number of cases that were “completed” by immigration judges. The government report looks at cases that finished with a grant of relief from removal or an order of removal, as well as the percent of case completions which involved an order of removal for failure to appear.In Fiscal Year 2017, there were 41,384 orders of removal for failure to appear issued out of 149,436 total cases completed. EOIR reported this as a 28 percent failure to appear rate. However, immigration court cases often require multiple hearings before they can be completed and, due to skyrocketing backlogs in the last decade, the average immigration court case takes almost three years to complete.The government’s statistic counts failures to appear only against the number of cases that are fully completed. By doing this, it neglects to account for the many immigrants who appeared in court in ongoing cases that have not yet reached completion.As a result, because tens of thousands of immigrants appeared in court in 2017 but did not have a case completed, EOIR’s number does not represent the rate at which immigrants missed court.Since there are now more than 800,000 people in immigration court, the failure to include these incomplete cases is extremely misleading.In addition, by only reviewing initial case completions, the statistic doesn’t consider cases where an immigrant missed court through no fault of their own (like in the event of an emergency) and then successfully overturned a removal order. According to an analysis from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), excluding cases where the immigrant successfully overturned a removal order for failure to appear “significantly impacts and reduces the calculated rates.”From 2012 to 2017, over 1.25 million new cases were filed in immigration court, but only 151,000 removal orders were issued for failure to appear; 13.5 percent of the total. When looking only at 2017, cases in which an immigrant was ordered removed for failure to appear constituted just five percent of the 802,503 cases pending or completed in immigration court.Despite the flaws with using the failure to appear rate as a proxy for the rate at which immigrants miss court proceedings, the government continues to use this number to make policy. This is a mistake; good policy can only be made based on good data.Given this error, what is the actual rate at which immigrants fail to appear in court? Unfortunately, there is no exact answer for this. But a series of studies has made one thing clear: the vast majority of asylum-seekers attend all their immigration court hearings.The Detaining Families report, for example, reviewed every case between 2001 and 2016 where a family was detained by ICE and then released. It determined that 86 percent of families had not missed a single court hearing. This number rose to 96 percent when a member of the family filed an application for asylum.Other studies have come to similar conclusions. According to a review of immigration court records by TRAC, only 22.9 percent of the 167,219 women and children who entered the United States between 2014 and 2017 were ordered removed for failure to appear. Those who managed to obtain counsel were the most likely to appear for their hearings; only 2.3 percent of that group were ordered removed for failure to appear.Even government studies show similar results. In 2018, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services published a study analyzing the outcomes of every person encountered by Customs and Border Protection in 2014. Of the roughly 60,000 individuals who sought asylum at the border that year, only 14 percent had been issued an order of removal that ICE was not able to carry out—likely because the asylum-seeker failed to appear in court and fled.As long-term studies show, when you actually track individual cases from start to finish, most asylum-seekers diligently appear in court. The government should make policy based on this reality and not their own flawed metrics.Tags:  EOIR, featured, immigration court backlog, TRACIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Speaking before Congress and the nation Tuesday evening, President Trump once again promised bipartisanship and instead delivered division. When it came to immigration, the president neither offered an olive branch nor acknowledged the devastating effects of his administration’s actions to date. Rather than offer solutions to the actual problems facing immigrants across the country, his speech reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of the state of immigration.Despite President Trump’s claims about border insecurity, the border is in fact safer and more secure than at any point in history. In the past two years, the number of people apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border has dropped to levels not seen since the 1970s. At the same time, the Border Patrol now estimates that it detects more than 90 percent of all attempts to cross the border.In addition, an increase in the arrival of families seeking asylum means that increasingly large numbers of asylum-seekers cross the border and then politely turn themselves in to the nearest Border Patrol officer. These families are not seeking to evade capture nor pose a threat to anyone; they are seeking access to the humanitarian protections that are at the foundation of American values.To the extent that there is a crisis at the border, it is one manufactured by the Trump administration. Rather than address the rising number of families by increasing capacity to process asylum seekers, the government has unveiled policy after policy seeking to stop people from coming in the first place. Some of those policies—like family separation or the ban on allowing asylum seekers to apply if they crossed between the ports of entry—have been halted by courts. Others, like the dangerous new policy forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they go through the court process, are just now going into effect. By focusing on deterrence instead of solutions, the administration has fueled a growing humanitarian disaster at the border.Trump continued to vilify individuals in the United States without status and painted compassion towards undocumented immigrants as a slight towards the native-born. But decades of research show that undocumented immigrants play a vital and important role in making this country great. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year through the use of an Individual Tax Identification Number. In addition, undocumented immigrants pay over $10 billion each year into Social Security despite not being eligible to draw from those funds.Far from hurting American workers, there is little competition between the unemployment rate and the presence of recent immigrants of all types. Instead, the presence of both documented and undocumented immigrants helps build America’s economic growth.In 2018, Trump built much of his State of the Union speech around a call for his “four pillars” of immigration reform, one of which involved cutting legal immigration levels in half by eliminating family-based immigration.This year, Trump deviated from his prepared speech and stated that “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever.” Unfortunately, over the past year his administration has worked harder than ever to cut legal immigration and make it more difficult to come to the United States.A recent analysis shows that processing delays at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have reached “crisis levels,” slowing down the legal immigration process for everyone. The administration is also seeking to redefine the legal term “public charge” to block green cards for low-income immigrants, an action which could further slash legal immigration. Refugee admissions have also been cut to their lowest levels ever.When people come together to address the actual immigration issues facing this country, they can agree on common-sense solutions. Polls show that 81 percent of Americans agree that undocumented immigrants should be given a path to citizenship. From decreasing the use of detention to providing a permanent path to status for DREAMers and those with Temporary Protected Status, there are bipartisan solutions that exist if only the president would acknowledge them.If Congress wants to achieve true immigration reform, it must acknowledge the actual state of immigration and not the dark tale presented by the president.Photo by the White HouseTags:  Donald Trump, featured, State of the Union, U.S.-Mexico Border, USCISIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'It has been two years since the Trump administration’s travel ban went into effect. Aside from multiple court challenges, the ban has largely disappeared from American headlines. And yet the ban continues to affect American families every single day.While this policy may be a quieter form of family separation than what has been seen at our southern border, its impact is also devastating. The current ban prohibits travel to the United States for groups of individuals from five Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen), as well as North Korea and Venezuela.The ban has resulted in the separation of thousands of U.S. citizens from their fiancés, spouses, and young children.New research from the Cato Institute finds that as of January 1, 2019, the travel ban has prevented 9,284 people from uniting with their U.S. citizen spouse or parent. By October 2019—the end of this fiscal year—an estimated 15,165 spouses, fiancés, and minor adopted children will have been banned from traveling to their U.S. citizen spouse or parent.By looking at the number of visa issuances from the five Muslim-majority countries before and after the travel ban, the research shows that as of January 1:The majority—57 percent—of these separated family members are from Yemen, which is currently being ravaged by a civil war. 16 percent are Somalis; 16 percent are Iranians; 9 percent are Syrians; and 2 percent are Libyans.Despite the administration’s claims, this policy is not about national security. No nationals from any of these countries have killed anyone in a terrorist attack in the United States in over 40 years, and no legal permanent resident from the targeted countries has even attempted to carry out a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.Congressional leaders are continuing to take the administration to task for its attempts to spin the ban as a national security issue. To mark the ban’s anniversary, Senator Richard Blumenthal and 15 cosponsors introduced a resolution to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to refugee resettlement. Senator Chris Murphy and Congresswoman Judy Chu also introduced legislation that would declare the ban unconstitutional and prevent federal funds from being used to implement it.But while the travel ban moves through the courts and Congress, families are still left in limbo. Two years in, there are endless accounts of the damage it is causing. This includes one American citizen of 28 years who is unable to receive visa paperwork for his terminally ill wife in Yemen.Another U.S. citizen describes the effect on his 8-year-old daughter, whose Yemeni mother is unable to travel to the United States after undergoing surgery abroad:“[She] is crying day and night. She wants her sisters and mother. She’s lost 10 pounds and bites her fingernails until the meat comes out.”Separating families is cruel and unnecessary. And the ban does not make Americans safer. The fact that U.S. families are in the crosshairs of this policy only makes it more outrageous.Tags:  Donald Trump, family separation, featured, Muslim BanIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'President Trump went in front of the public on Saturday and claimed he was going to propose a “compromise” to end the ongoing government shutdown. Instead of offering a bipartisan bill that would protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients from deportation, the 1300-page bill unveiled Monday night was loaded with broad attacks on protections for children and asylum seekers.Calling these provisions “a poison pill,” Democratic leaders swiftly denounced the plan, indicating that the “compromise” bill was dead on arrival.In exchange for massive restrictions on asylum and the gutting of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for future beneficiaries, the Trump administration is only offering short-term “fixes.” This includes a costly, difficult-to-obtain temporary reprieve for individuals with DACA and current TPS holders from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti. This new status, “provisional protected presence,” would apply for three years and then expire. There is no path to citizenship.Aside from being temporary, the proposed status outlined in the bill would likely do little for those with DACA or TPS, as the administration’s attempts to end both of these protections have so far mostly failed.On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court remained silent about whether they would take up a request to hear a case challenging the elimination of DACA. Even if the Court later decides to hear the case, arguments would not be until at least the fall of 2019. As a result, DACA beneficiaries will be able to renew their status through at least this year, which may reduce pressure on including DACA protections in a near-term budget compromise. Similarly, many TPS holders whose status was terminated by the administration remain protected due to court actions.The bill unveiled on Monday, called the BRIDGE Act (despite bearing little resemblance to a previous bipartisan bill bearing the same name), limits new protections only to those who currently have DACA, or those who have TPS from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti. However, the bill imposes additional restrictions that would prevent many from being eligible for the new status, including some who are already DACA and TPS recipients.Among these restrictions are a series of financial burdens designed to make it hard for low-income recipients to qualify for the new status. In order to qualify, DACA and TPS recipients would have to satisfy a higher burden of proof for eligibility, prove that they would be able to maintain an income no less than 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, and in some cases would have to repay refundable tax credits that they had lawfully received.In exchange for this extremely limited and expensive new status, the bill includes the president’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall, along with an increase in ICE detention to 52,000 beds and money for additional Border Patrol and ICE agents.The bill also includes a series of poison pill amendments which strip asylum eligibility from children from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Those children would be rendered ineligible for asylum unless they go through a new application process that requires them to apply in their home countries or in other Central American countries.Under this new process, only 50,000 applications would be accepted each year, and only 15,000 asylum grants would be permitted. Children would also have to prove they have a “qualified parent or guardian” in the United States to establish eligibility.In addition to these and other major restrictions on asylum for children, the bill proposes a series of changes to asylum applications in general. For example, asylum applications could be deemed “frivolous” if the applicant “in whole or in part” requests asylum in order to obtain work authorization, which many applicants need to do to support themselves while they await a decision.The bill also further limits humanitarian protections by gutting the future of TPS by limiting it only to individuals “lawfully present” in the United States when a disaster or conflict strikes their home country. This loses sight of the original purpose of TPS—to provide temporary safe haven to people in the United States based on a discreet need for protection, regardless of immigration status.Despite the president’s claim that this bill was a “compromise,” the devil was indeed in the details. It’s a laundry list of attacks on critical protections for children, asylum seekers, and those fleeing disasters. It is not a serious attempt at finding common ground. Given the bill’s chilly reception, any hopes that it would be the vehicle to end the shutdown seems highly unlikely.Tags:  BRIDGE Act, Donald Trump, El Salvador, featured, Haiti, HondurasIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'A federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s plan to add a question on U.S. citizenship to the 2020 Census on Tuesday, ruling that the controversial move “violated the public trust” and would be damaging to immigrants.Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the administration’s intention to add the question – “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” to the Census back in March 2018.Plans to move forward with the new question became quickly tied up in various legal battles, as many feared it would decrease participation in the Census among immigrants. Six former Census Bureau directors also came out in opposition of a citizenship question.In his 277-page ruling, Judge Jesse Furman determined that the secretary had exceeded his authority and the addition had not undergone the rigorous testing required of all new Census questions. Furman also ruled that Ross had concealed “his real reason” for adding the question in the first place.Ross reportedly drafted the question after consulting with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and politician Kris Kobach, all known for their anti-immigrant views.Including such a question would damage immigrant communities, both advocates and the judge argued. This would be particularly true among noncitizen households.Manipulating the 2020 Census—which will be used to determine electoral college votes in U.S. elections, congressional seats, and federal funding for the next 10 years—would have a lasting impact on political representation.The Court found that a decline in self-response rates among noncitizens households would “cause several jurisdictions to lose seats in the next congressional apportionment and that it will cause another set of jurisdictions to lose political representation in the next round of intrastate redistricting.”Losing that political power would essentially strip already underrepresented communities of key representation and resources. Population Reference Bureau estimates that up to one in 10 U.S. households—or 45 million people—would be at risk of not being counted if a citizenship question is asked.The Trump administration has not announced how it will respond to the judgement, but the government could appeal or move the case directly to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court decides to take up the full case, then it could be heard in the spring.As it stands, however, Judge Furman’s ruling is a welcome victory for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the Census.Tags:  citizenship, Donald Trump, featured, Supreme CourtIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'On Sunday night, President-Elect Donald Trump repeated his pledge to begin deporting undocumented immigrants but he narrowed in on two to three million immigrants who he dubbed “criminal.”He said:“What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.” This two to three million number has been bandied about for months and also thoroughly debunked. The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates that the number of undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions is likely closer to 820,000. However, many of these 820,000 “criminals” include individuals who have only committed minor traffic offenses or immigration violations; not violent crimes and thus they do not represent a grave threat to society.In addition, even at the height of deportations executed by the Obama Administration the highest yearly removal numbers were around 400,000 having dropped only last year as the Administration tried to narrow its enforcement priorities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also stated previously that its current funding levels, which have remained largely level since 2012, only lend themselves to around 400,000 deportations in any given year. So in order to accomplish such a feat, the new administration would need Congressional cooperation and over the weekend House Speaker Ryan remarked that there would be no deportation force.In an attempt to ramp up removals, the new administration could increase cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement agencies. This has been done in the past with programs like Secure Communities. However, it’s unlikely the new administration would get broad buy-in across the nation as many law enforcement agencies pulled out of those types of programs due to the negative consequences of entangling immigration enforcement and law enforcement.\xa0Additionally,\xa0many cities \xa0have already come forward since the election to signal they will in fact take steps to protect immigrants living in their local communities.What would also boost removal numbers back up to their highest levels would be ending “non-enforcement directives” or memos which urge ICE officers to prioritize public threats for removal and deprioritize low level or simple immigration violators, which would make potentially every undocumented immigrant a target for deportation.However, now that President-elect Trump is off the campaign trail, and says he appreciates the responsibility of his new role; he should begin thinking soberly about what his immigration policies should be. The nation would be better served by fair and sensible approaches that reflect the will of the American people and respects the humanity of our immigrant communities.Tags:  Donald Trump, featured, Immigration and Customs EnforcementIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'If the U.S. government closes the door to highly skilled foreign workers, other countries stand ready to embrace their contributions. For instance, while the Trump administration contemplates an overhaul of the H-1B temporary employment visa, a process that would make it more difficult to obtain them, the Canadian government is offering the opposite. Canada is promising a two-week turn-around time on work permits for skilled foreign workers who are in the United States, but who might like to try Canada instead.The U.S. government and employers must create a welcoming environment that attracts skilled people from around the world, because the United States is no longer the default choice for foreign workers looking for new opportunities.This is one of the central conclusions of a new book, “The Gift of Global Talent,”\xa0by Harvard Business School professor William Kerr.The book synthesizes much of the existing research on high-skilled immigration and reaches a number of important conclusions. Paramount among these is that “talent is the world’s most precious resource.” The accuracy of this statement becomes apparent if you consider that computers, cars, and factories would not exist if not for the creativity of engineers and other high-tech professionals.Moreover, talent is highly mobile. Talented workers can readily travel to any corner of the globe where opportunity beckons to them—meaning that forward-looking nations must actively compete for these workers and not take them for granted.“The Gift of Global Talent” argues that one unique feature of talented individuals is that they tend to congregate in a relatively small number of places—like Silicon Valley, or equivalent locations in Canada, Europe, and Asia.Contrary to conventional economic thinking, this tendency to collect in one city doesn’t drive down wages or produce a surplus of workers. Rather, it makes the place even more attractive to other talented professionals. In Kerr’s terminology, this process gives birth to “talent clusters”—and it is the talent clusters that fuel innovation.As the author notes, the degree to which foreign-born workers contribute to the growth of these clusters is readily apparent in a couple of statistics. Immigrants account for one-quarter of all U.S. patents filed. And more than half of all U.S. workers with doctorates in science and engineering fields are immigrants.The talent clusters that have taken root in the United States would not exist in their present form without immigration. Likewise, these immigrants would not have been able to come without visas specifically designed for highly skilled professionals, such as the H-1B.To succeed in such a global labor market, businesses must be nimble; quick to follow new ideas and attract the workers needed to develop those new ideas. For this reason, many businesses very deliberately set up shop in the middle of a talent cluster so that they will have ready access to whatever sort of talented workers are needed as the business moves forward.The primary obstacle to getting the workers they need rests in the inefficiencies of the U.S. employment visa system (particularly flaws in the H-1B, such as the fact that the visa is tied to a single employer and is not “portable” if the worker wants to get a different job in a different company). These obstacles would only increase with changes to the visa’s availability being contemplated by the Trump administration.At a broader level, the administration’s anti-immigrant policies have already caused the United States to lose some of its luster as a home for global talent. This is an economically self-destructive course of action that must be reversed. Workers who possess knowledge and ingenuity transcend borders. Rational immigration policies would recognize this basic fact.Photo by\xa0NESA by MakersTags:  Donald Trump, employment-based immigration, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'In recent months, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has methodically ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for six countries, including over 300,000 people from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. Newly revealed State Department cables now confirm that the Trump administration’s interest in ending these designations superseded stark warnings from U.S. embassies on the ground about the destabilizing effects these terminations would have on a region already plagued by violence and other challenges.The Washington Post reported on an investigation conducted by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee into how decisions were made to terminate TPS for El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. State Department cables reportedly included strong opposition to ending TPS, which was overruled without justification in the formal recommendation to DHS by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), ranking member of the committee, referred to Tillerson’s position as the “deliberate disregard” of the expertise of career diplomats.U.S. law requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with other government agencies prior to making a decision about extending or terminating a TPS designation. The consultative process is designed to ensure that there is a thorough review of conditions in the foreign country to determine whether a TPS designation is still warranted. Designations can be based on ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. The purpose of TPS is to ensure that the U.S. government is not deporting people to a country that is unsafe or unable to absorb them if conditions there have become seriously problematic.Many observers and advocates have been questioning how the Trump administration was approaching these TPS decisions and sought to challenge the decision-making process in court.In response to the termination of TPS for Haiti in November 2018, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a lawsuit, arguing that the deviation from the normal decision making process was “irrational and discriminatory” and guided by the administration’s “public hostility toward immigrants of color.” A separate challenge to the termination of TPS for El Salvador argued that “the termination was based not on a reasoned consideration of country conditions… but rather motivated by racial animus….”Plaintiffs in yet another lawsuit challenging the termination of TPS for Haiti obtained documents that shed light on the problematic termination recommendation made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Francis Cissna to the DHS Secretary. Despite his conclusions that “Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” the internal government report he relied on to support his recommendation made clear that Haiti continued “to be affected by a convergence of humanitarian needs including food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.”Although it’s unlikely that DHS will revisit the decisions to terminate so many TPS designations in light of these revelations, they are a stark reminder that over 300,000 TPS beneficiaries may face being deported to risky, unsafe, and extremely difficult countries they left long ago. For example, more than half of TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador and Haiti have lived in the United States for over twenty years.The U.S. government’s decision to end their status and deport them should not be taken lightly. DHS has an obligation to make sound decisions based on the facts, especially when people’s lives are at stake.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, featured, U.S. State DepartmentIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Just months short of the normal starting date for the annual H-1B petition process, USCIS has proposed major changes. U.S. employers who rely on this visa category, which is for jobs that require a bachelor’s or higher degree in a “specific specialty” or equivalent at the entry-level, are now in limbo, unsure whether these changes will be implemented before the normal petition-submission date.Just last week, USCIS issued a proposal to change the current system for H-1B “cap-subject” petitions. The proposal has two components: requiring employers to register online in advance to be eligible to submit an H-1B petition and reversing the order in which petitions are selected.Currently, USCIS selects petitions for the 20,000 “master’s exemption” first (for workers with a master’s or higher degree from U.S. colleges or universities that meet certain requirements). Any of these not selected are included when USCIS selects petitions for the 65,000 “cap.” (Selection is only the first step: USCIS has to accept a selected petition for filing, and then decide whether to approve.)USCIS has provided a 30-day comment period, ending January 2, 2019. It appears that USCIS wants to proceed with the change in the selection process for April 2019, even if—as is likely—the registration system is not ready.As proposed, USCIS would provide at least 30 days’ advance notice, through its website, of the registration start date. The registration period would run for at least 14 days, beginning at least 14 days before the first business day in April on which H-1B petitions could be filed.When registering, the employer would have to identify the foreign national it intends to hire. As a result, the employer would have less time to consider hiring foreign nationals who need an H-1B classification.When the initial registration period ends, if USCIS has more registrations than required for visa number allocation, the agency will hold a “lottery,” but keep the unselected registrations “on reserve” for that fiscal year. If there are less registrations than needed, then USCIS will open another registration period.For any registrations selected, USCIS will notify employers and provide at least 60 days within which to file. USCIS anticipates that it will stagger the filings to help the agency manage its workflow.The proposal increases uncertainty because employers will need to proceed as if they will be required to register but also will need to prepare their H-1B petitions since registration is unlikely—and they will not know if their petitions are less likely to be selected than before if the petition does not fall within the “master’s exemption.”The registration process also injects even greater uncertainty than currently exists as to when USCIS may make a decision on a petition—because USCIS will control how long the registration period lasts and the time period during which a selected registrant may file an H-1B petition.USCIS describes the proposal as a “merit-based” rule in support of President Trump’s Buy American and Hire American Executive Order to “suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.” Since current law does not have a “most-skilled” or “highest-paid” hierarchy for H-1B eligibility, it is questionable whether USCIS could accomplish this through regulation. But even apart from its legality, it remains to be seen whether the proposal would favor those with master’s degrees from U.S. schools that meet the “master’s exemption” requirements.USCIS assumes that “master’s exemption” petitions would be for jobs requiring more skills and at a higher salary. But the “master’s exemption” is determined by the degree the beneficiary holds.The job offered to the beneficiary may or may not require a master’s degree. Also, the salary an employer offers depends on several factors, such as the type of job, the geographic location, and whether prior work experience is required.With these variables, there are many situations in which a job requiring a bachelor’s degree and work experience would be the “most-skilled” and “highest paid.”Also, what makes a U.S. master’s degree from a low-ranking U.S. university more meritorious than, say, a Ph.D. from Oxford.It also is possible that the proposed new selection order will harm a particular industry, or a particular region, which could reduce the income and opportunities for U.S. workers.The agency acknowledges that it “has not been able to determine how this may impact particular industries currently submitting H-1B cap petitions for individuals without master’s degrees … and how this may impact particular types of workers” and “welcomes input.” Comments should be submitted to furnish the critical data that USCIS lacks.\xa0\xa0Tags:  featured, H1-B VisasIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'The Trump administration has slowed the processing of immigration benefit applications to a crawl, causing needless harm to immigrants, their families, and their employers. Under President Trump, the backlog of applications at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) doubled in the span of only one year.A recent analysis of USCIS data by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) refers to these “crisis-level delays”\xa0 as “bricks in the Trump administration’s ‘invisible wall’ curbing legal immigration in the United States.”The numbers bear this out. According to AILA’s analysis, the average case processing time for all application types has increased 46 percent since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016—the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. These escalating delays have occurred even when the number of new applications has fallen. For instance, from FY 2017 to 2018, processing times increased by 19 percent even though receipts of new applications declined 17 percent. So the delays cannot be plausibly blamed on rising workload.In fact, this state of affairs is exactly the opposite of what USCIS was intended to do. When USCIS was created in 2002, elimination of application backlogs—and prevention of future backlogs—were explicit priorities of the new agency. USCIS was meant to be an agency that provided immigration benefits to customers; it was not intended to function like an enforcement agency.But the tables have turned in the Trump era, with the institution of new security protocols that needlessly drag out the processing of virtually every application. For instance, in-person interviews are now required for each and every employment-based green card applicant. The administration’s overhaul of the refugee program has also brought processing of many cases to a complete standstill.From FY 2017 to FY 2018, the processing time of an N-400 (Application for Naturalization) rose from 8 months to over 10. Processing an I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) went from 8 to 11 months. And the processing time of an I-765 (Application for Work Authorization) rose from 3 to 4 months.Delays of this magnitude have serious repercussions when people can’t get a job, join their families, or escape refugee camps. The report cautions:“Longer processing times mean families struggle to make ends meet, survivors of violence and torture face danger, and U.S. companies fall behind.”The report suggests USCIS should begin providing service to its customers again rather than approaching everyone as a security risk. It also urges Congress to exercise some oversight authority over the agency, which has been sorely lacking during the past two years. Finally, USCIS operations should be made more transparent to the public so it is clear why applications take so long to process.USCIS processing delays and application backlogs under the Trump administration are having a devastating impact on the legal immigration system. This, in turn, is having an unnecessarily negative effect on families and employers across the country.Tags:  Donald Trump, featured, processing times, USCISIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'The horrifying and tragic legacy of the Trump administration’s family separation policy—which allegedly ended by executive order in June this summer—is far from over. Even with many children still waiting to be reunited with their parents, the administration is considering resuming family separations once again.Nearly 250 migrant children reportedly remain separated from their parents. Of those, 125 children have made the decision to stay in the United States without their parents (who have already been deported) to seek asylum. Another 120 children remain separated from their parents and still hope to reunify with them.These separations don’t tell the full story of the damage done by the “zero tolerance” policy. A recent report released by Amnesty International reveals that over 6,000 “family units” may have been separated from April 19, 2018 until August 15, 2018—over twice as many as the government alleges.Many had hoped that the United States could close this shameful chapter of immigration policy. But just last week, media reports suggest that the administration is indeed considering a different—though equally insidious—form of family separation. Under this proposal, benignly termed a “binary choice,” immigrant families would either remain together in jail or agree to be separated, with the children being transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and the parents remaining behind bars.The proposal—if implemented—would lead to the prolonged detention of many migrant children, as many parents would not be willing to release their children to government custody, particularly given the horrors that unfolded this summer. Currently, there are nearly 80 reunified mothers and their children who have been detained for many months at the country’s largest family detention center in Dilley, Texas. Many of the mothers wrote letters to the public talking about their experiences being forcibly separated from their children, and their continued detainment with no end in sight.These stories illustrate the horrors that will again unfold should the administration pursue another policy of family separation.The “binary choice” option is one of several that the administration is reportedly considering to respond to the arrival of a migrant caravan from Central America and to address the high numbers of families and children recently arriving at our Southern border in search of asylum. But the concerns about the number of arrivals are being wildly overstated; data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows that overall migration is actually at a historic low.The proposal to separate families anew is problematic on numerous fronts. The cruelty of taking children away from their parents needs no explanation; but the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) failure to account for, identify, and keep track of the families it separated and to coordinate meaningful communication between separated family members made the policy especially untenable. Just this month, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a scathing report making clear that DHS was “not fully prepared to implement the Zero Tolerance Policy.”Numerous accounts have surfaced over the past several months of extensive coercion and misrepresentation used by DHS agents to facilitate the separations, which begs the question: what will prevent the government from resorting to the same abusive and coercive practices if is permitted to reintroduce a similar policy?Tags:  Family Detention, family separation, featured, U.S.-Mexico BorderIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'In May, a group of undocumented parents, represented by South Texas Civil Rights Project and Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid, filed a lawsuit against the State of Texas for denying their children, born in the state, birth certificates. The legal team also asked the judge to issue a preliminary injunction—a temporary order that would force the state to issue birth certificates while the underlying case moves forward in court. A few days ago, the judge denied the preliminary injunction, while at the same time noting the State’s refusal to issue birth certificates “raises grave concerns regarding the treatment of citizen children born to immigrant parents.” This means the underlying case continues and, but in the meantime, the state may continue its policy of denying birth certificates to certain immigrant parents.The underlying issue is that the State of Texas will no longer accept a parent’s “Matricula” card— an identification card issued by the Mexican Government through its consulates—as an acceptable form of identification for purposes of obtaining a child’s birth certificate. The state says it has concerns with the validity of these cards. The state says it is only interested in “regulating with care the process of accessing birth certificates “ and that it has concerns over the quality of the Matricula cards. The Mexican government responded in an amicus brief (i.e., “friend of the court brief”) that Matricula cards are perfectly valid; in fact, they have been upgraded to include an electronic chip and other security measures designed to prevent counterfeiting.Related Content:\xa0Made in America: Myths & Facts about Birthright CitizenshipThe undocumented parents allege their “children were denied birth certificates because their parents lacked proof of U.S. citizenship or legal status,” and their legal team is arguing “that Texas-born children of immigrants are entitled to birth certificates, and said their constitutional rights were being violated.”It’s true that children born on U.S. soil are entitled to U.S. Citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution – the cornerstone of American civil rights – affirms that, with very few exceptions, all persons born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the immigration status of their parents. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld birthright citizenship over the years and this seriously calls into question Texas’ decision to deny these children birth certificates.However the legal team fighting the case in Texas seems unshaken by the judge’s latest decision. Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Dallas Morning News:“the judge’s denial wasn’t surprising given the difficulty of getting such injunctions. ‘There are areas where he wants more proof about what happened to the plaintiffs,’ Harrington said. ‘…Basically, he laid out a road map of what he wants to see at trial before he makes his final decision.’”Harrington expects the court to set a date for the trial soon.Photo by Katelyn Kenderdine.Tags:  Birthright Citizenship, featured, TexasIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing entitled “Birthright Citizenship: Is It The Right Policy For America?” The hearing will question whether those born in America will automatically be citizens, as they have been for over 150 years. Undoubtedly, the hearing will feature the same counterproductive anti-immigrant rhetoric that nativists have trotted out before, in support of a proposal that would harm America while violating our ideals. Just recently, Rep. Steve King introduced, for the third time, a bill that would end birthright citizenship—leading (among other actions) to the introduction of the “Restrain Steve King from Legislating Act.” It is remarkable that Congress, in 2015, is holding a hearing to consider this.First, it is doubtful that legislation to repeal birthright citizenship would be constitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Based on this, the Supreme Court has upheld birthright citizenship for children of foreigners several times—holding that the Fourteenth Amendment means what it says, especially in light of its history.Moreover, repealing birthright citizenship is unnecessary. There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. in large numbers just to give birth. “Anchor babies,” a term the American Heritage Dictionary calls offensive and disparaging, make no sense given that a child cannot sponsor a parent for citizenship for at least 21 years. And hyperbolic stories about “birth tourism” point to small numbers of foreigners who come to the U.S. legally to give birth to their children.Further, repealing birthright citizenship would be incredibly unwise and unworkable, affecting everyone—not just immigrants. If birthright citizenship was eliminated, all American parents would have to establish the citizenship of their children, through arduous, expensive, bureaucratic processes. The United States would likely have to create a national “birth registry,” and some sort of national ID to be used as proof of citizenship. Americans could be denied citizenship because of a mistake. It would be ridiculous to impact every single American just to punish a few individuals.Lastly, repealing birthright citizenship would be un-American. As the Center for American Progress’ Marshall Fitz pointed out today, the “14th\xa0Amendment is not just another immigration policy.” “It defines who we are as a nation,” and “categorically rejects the notion that America is a country club led by elites who get to pick and choose who can become members.” And as President Richard Cohen of the Southern Poverty Law Center tells Congress, repealing birthright citizenship “would risk creating a new class of second-class citizens.”Eliminating birthright citizenship is regrettably, a distraction that moves us away from fixing the real problems with our broken immigration system. Repealing birthright citizenship would increase the size of the undocumented population, not reduce undocumented immigration. For example, a 2010 Migration Policy Institute study found that if citizenship were denied to every child with at least one unauthorized parent, the unauthorized population in the U.S. would reach 24 million by 2050.The American public wants real solutions, not proposals that look tough on immigrants but are ineffective and harmful. Tomorrow’s hearing will unfortunately provide the latter.Photo by Gage Skidmore.Tags:  Birthright Citizenship, Center for American Progress, featured, Hearings, house judiciary committee, Migration Policy Institute, Southern Poverty Law Center, steve kingIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'If there’s one constant throughout human history, it’s that everything changes. New scientific discoveries are made and new technologies are invented. New nations are born from the ashes of warfare or revolution. And people move from place to place in search of better lives for themselves and their descendants. In a society like the United States, migration continually shapes and reshapes the demographic composition of the population—a process that is often resisted by those whose ancestors came here long ago.For instance, at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, immigrants were arriving en masse from southern and eastern Europe—much to the dismay of some Americans who were the descendants of the first immigrants from northwestern Europe. And now, with no small measure of irony, some of the descendants of European immigrants are decrying the arrival of so many immigrants from Latin America and Asia.That is exactly what the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) does in a May report devoted to enumerating an immigration “surge” in 2014 and 2015—which CIS acknowledges is, in part, a response to improved U.S. economic conditions. The report is devoted to slicing and dicing the numbers on this “surge,” which originates in South Asia, East Asia, and Latin American countries other than Mexico. CIS worries about the assimilation of these immigrants, and their impact on the educational system, and their effect on U.S. society as a whole. In other words, the same worries that were probably directed at the immigrant ancestors of the CIS staff.CIS is basically fretting about the inevitability of change. And they are sounding the alarm over something that is old news: the day when non-Latino whites become a minority in the United States. In a 2015 report, the Pew Research Center estimated that the foreign-born share of the population is now approaching 14 percent—which is still not quite as high as it was in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Pew points out that “for the past half-century, these modern-era immigrants and their descendants have accounted for just over half the nation’s population growth and have reshaped its racial and ethnic composition.” More precisely:“In 1965, 84% of Americans were non-Hispanic whites. By 2015, that share had declined to 62%. Meanwhile, the Hispanic share of the U.S. population rose from 4% in 1965 to 18% in 2015. Asians also saw their share rise, from less than 1% in 1965 to 6% in 2015.”This shift in the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population will persist:“Non-Hispanic whites are projected to become less than half of the U.S. population by 2055 and 46% by 2065…Hispanics will see their population share rise to 24% by 2065 from 18% today, while Asians will see their share rise to 14% by 2065 from 6% today.”In the latter part of the 19th century, British immigrants and their U.S.-born children often decried the arrival of immigrants from Italy. From the perspective adopted by some of the British and their descendants, Italians were just too different to fit into U.S. society. It was thought that they wouldn’t learn English or otherwise “assimilate.” Obviously, the passage of time has proven this view to be wrong. Now, it’s possible to find Italian Americans who express identical worries about the Mexicans and Central Americans coming to this country.This is the perpetual worry of the nativist: that “they” won’t learn the language or fit in or have a positive impact on U.S. society. And so the nativist reflex is to keep “them” out—be it through the construction of walls in the desert or the mass deportation of those not legally authorized to be here. In other words, nativists are forever trying to turn back the demographic clock—back to a time when the descendants of European immigrants comfortably outnumbered those of Latin American or Asian ancestry.But times change, and so do the people who call the United States home. That is the way it has always been.Photo by DalloPhoto.Tags:  center for immigration studies, featured, Pew Research CenterIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'As we move through the 2016 presidential election cycle, the issue of immigration will continue to be a central topic of the debate. The United States is at a tipping point after more than two decades without meaningful upgrades to its immigration system. Current U.S. law does not provide sufficient channels for legal immigration and does not respond to the country’s economic needs. As a result, we have a mismatch between labor supply and demand that is most dramatically illustrated by the millions of undocumented immigrants living in our country today.Related Content:\xa0Giving the Facts a Fighting Chance: Addressing Common Questions on ImmigrationAdding to the momentous challenge of reforming our immigration system is the fact that much of the debate around it is taking place in the context of a heated presidential election, where misstatements and half-truths often go unchecked. This makes it difficult for the public, who by and large support reform, to understand the nuts and bolts of what is needed to truly upgrade our immigration system.In order to support a sane and fact-based debate, the American Immigration Council issued a guide, Giving the Facts a Fighting Chance: Addressing Common Questions on Immigration, which provides answers to many of the most common questions about current policies and what immigration means to the United States both socially and economically. The guide delves into a wide range of issues including the economic benefits of immigration, the high cost and diminishing returns of immigration enforcement, the various roles states play in immigration policy, and the importance of additional due process protections for those in immigration court proceedings.The guide also tackles misinformation spread by some presidential candidates including accusations that immigrants tend to have high rates of criminal behavior. The truth is high rates of immigration actually equate with low levels of crime.Additionally, the guide also answers questions around the much-debated topic of refugee admissions into the United States and reminds us that refugees are actually the most scrutinized group of migrants that enter the country:The guide also provides striking economic data regarding immigrant entrepreneurship:Answers to many other questions that arise in the immigration reform debate are addressed in this \xa0guide and it makes clear the U.S. immigration system is very different today than it was when prior generations of immigrants arrived. In fact, it notes that many of our ancestors might not have been allowed to enter the country had today’s laws been in effect even though today’s immigrants make enormous contributions to our economy and our communities—just as immigrants in the past did. Finally, the guide reminds us that any immigration policies we develop today must be based on facts and data, not hyperbole or political pot shots.Tags:  demographics, Election 2016, Entrepreneurship, Family Detention, featured, immigration reformIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

'NO ALCOHOL IN HERE!'\xa0Dude was serious too.\xa0I know because he pointed his spatula at me while he yelled it.\xa0In my experience that means a chef is serious.\xa0Not as serious as when he points a knife at you...\xa0but very serious still.\xa0I started back out for the street without complaint or negotiation and I figured I'd just knock the rest of that delicious frozen concoction back and then return for some late night snackin' action and right before I hit the door  the entire staff at the 'Grill started laughing and the cook yelled 'JUST KIDDING' and the whole place erupted into a party while the counterman accused me of 'conspiracy to abuse alcohol' by throwing the drink away because he thought I was gonna pitch it even though I vehemently insisted that I was gonna just drink it out on the street... which they seem to encourage down here in New Orleans.\xa0I finished it at the counter while I ordered me some munch.\xa0That's when it struck me.\xa0'Alcohol' IS the SECRET INGREDIENT in those things!\xa0It totally gave me a killer mid-night craving for a Reuben Sandwich which the guys at the Camellia Grill took care of after numerous bouts of fist bumping for  even walking in there with one of those alcohol infused Slurpees.\xa0They were good sports and they do fire up a tasty Reuben there.\xa0Then I was off to 'La La Land.'\xa0I woke up at five am to get a little bit of work done and after puttin' in an hour or so on the 'puter some coffee sounded like a good idea.\xa0Those Slurpees kinda left me feelin' a little 'unhealthy' this morning and I thought maybe a jog before that would be just the thing.\xa0But since I don't jog I ditched that idea and decided that a plate of deep fried dough with a cup and a half of powdered sugar poured over it would be a better way to start my day.\xa0You guys all mentioned Cafe Du Monde so I thought I'd see what kinda taste all my Flickr friends have.\xa0I ordered a Cafe Au Lait and a plate of Beignets.\xa0'Beignets' is a french word that translates roughly to 'a scrumptuous pillow of dough like a doughnut without a hole in it covered in a copious amount of powdered sugar,'\xa0Man those things were good.\xa0So much better than an early morning jog.\xa0I don't know about the coffee though...\xa0it's that 'chicory' thing...\xa0it's another French word... which I translate roughly as 'tastes like licking a French woman's armpit after she's been jogging.'\xa0Still...

 'Russ & Daughters, located at 179 East Houston Street, is a fourth-generation appetizing store.  Joel Russ, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, arrived on New York\'s lower east side at the turn of the century and starting out selling herrings from a pushcart.  In 1914, he opened a storefront on Orchard Street before moving into the present former tenement building around the corner in 1920.  He called it "Russ\' Cut-Rate Appetizers.  \xa0Russ\' temper was famous in the neighborhood and business lagged until his three pretty, personable daughters--Haddie, Ida and Anne--took over behind the counter.   In 1978, after 10 years of practicing law, Mark Russ Federman, Ane\'s son, returned to the family business to help run the operation alongside his wife, Maria.  In 2002, Joshua Russ Tupper left his career as a chemical engineer to continue to the family legacy, and was joined by cousin Niki Russ Federman in 2006.\xa0In the early days, stock was limited to schmaltz herring, pickles and salt-cured lox.

 'Looking up and southwest at a closeup of the statue of Blind Justice on front of the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia.  This courthouse is home to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\xa0The statue and architrave constitute the artwork "Justice Delayed, Justice Denied."  This is a 1994 artwork by American sculptor Raymond Kaskey.  The statue depicts the traditional "Blind Justice," holding the scales of justice in each hand.  The statue leans out over the entrance of the courthouse, her robes billowing in the wind.\xa0The architrave below the pedestal is inscribed with a Maryland tortoise projecting out from the center, with racing hares on either side.  The image of a tortoise with a billowing sail on its back was the symbol of Cosimo de\' Medici, the wealthy businessman who ruled the city of Florence from behind the scenes in the early 1400s and who founded a vast political and religious dynasty.  His motton was "Make Haste Slowly." The billowing robes of Blind Justice, standing atop the tortoise, echoes this motto.\xa0However, the animals also evoke the classic fable of "The Tortoise and the Hare."  The moral of that story is "slow and steady wins the race."\xa0Judge Albert V. Bryan was a conservative federal judge who, in the 1950s and 1960s, ordered the racial integration of public schools in Virginia.  No one expected Judge Bryan to rule in favor of racial integration.  For more than two decades, Judge Bryan balanced the need for haste in order to protect constitutional rights with the need for due deliberation in the administration of justice.\xa0Together, the two mottos depict the tension in the law which Judge Bryan so ably administered.\xa0Blind Justice\'s left foot stands on a small dome atop a pedestal.  Her right foot is extended behind her.  The pedestral is inscribed with the phrase "Justice Delayed, Justice Denied."\xa0This 10-story, 285-foot high U.S. federal courthouse was designed by Spillis Candela & Partners in association with John Carl Warnecke & Associates.  Construction began in 1992, and was complete in 1995.  It is located at 401 Courthouse Square in Alexandria, Virginia, USA.',

 'New population projections from the University of Virginia’s Demographics Research Group show that in many states in the Northeast and Midwest, growth of the working-age population is slowing due to aging, lower fertility rates, and people moving out of the state. The aging of the workforce in the working-age population can mean shrinking workforces and potential economic problems. As a result, states need to think about how immigration can ameliorate impending trouble.By 2020, the number of working age adults (age 25-54) will decline in 16 states. For example, in Maine, while the overall population is expected to decrease by about two percent, the working age population will decline by 16 percent. Vermont and West Virginia can also expect declines of more than 10 percent, while Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin can expect more than five percent decline.\xa0A shrinking working-age population can hurt a state’s economy: businesses close due to a lack of workers and customers, housing prices drop, schools close, and tax revenue declines. Troubled states “will become less attractive to the people who are already there, and less attractive to newcomers,” according to UC-Berkeley demographer Ronald Lee.The decline in the working-age population will not be offset by births. The current\xa0total fertility rate is about 1.86 children per woman and would need to be at least 2.08 for the population to replenish itself. At the same time, the U.S. population is getting older and living longer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that by 2024, Americans age 55 and older will increase by 18.2 million—reaching 102.9 million, or 38.2 percent of all people in the country.Immigration mitigates these trends. In many areas of the country, the foreign born have accounted for more than 20 percent of the growth of the adult population since 1990. In some areas – mainly in the Midwest – overall adult population would have declined if not for an increase in the foreign born population. Almost half of immigrants admitted between 2003 and 2012 were between the ages of 20 and 40, while only 5 percent were ages 65 or older.Immigrant workers will likely be needed to replace retiring native-born workers and to provide them with needed care. The aging of the U.S. population will generate a high demand for healthcare workers of all kinds, and immigrants will likely be needed to meet growing demand.According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, worldwide population growth has been slowing for decades and will continue to decline over the next century. However, “Immigration is an important reason why the United States can anticipate less severe demographic challenges than most other developed countries… [Its] approach to immigration has helped the United States maintain a younger population and a higher fertility rate. Moving forward, the United States can expect to maintain its demographic advantage—provided that America retains its historic edge in attracting immigrants, integrating them, and allowing them to reach their full economic potential.”While immigration can be a hotly debated political topic, the bottom line is – given an aging population and low fertility rates – immigrants need to be a part of the country’s future if we’re going to remain a leader in the world economy.Photo Courtesy of DFID.Tags:  Bipartisan Policy Center, Connecticut, featured, Illinois, immigrant workforce, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, WisconsinIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'Last week, Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) introduced the Willing Workers and Willing Employers Act of 2016, which would establish a 10-year guest worker pilot program. According to Flake, the bill offers new thinking on how to bridge the gap between existing temporary worker programs for seasonal workers and the H-1B program for highly-skilled immigrants. Flake’s bill would create the H-2C visa program, which would allow foreign workers with less than a bachelor’s degree to perform year-round non-agricultural work in the United States.Currently, there are several temporary worker programs including the H-1B visa, which allows employers to employ foreign highly skilled workers, the H-2A visa for temporary or seasonal agricultural workers, and the H-2B visa for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural workers. There are generally no temporary visa for year-round workers for professions that require less than a bachelor’s degree. The H-1B and H-2B programs are subject to numerical caps, which many employers say are too low and do not match labor demand.Some immigrant advocates, organized labor, and others have concerns that existing temporary worker programs hurt both U.S. and foreign workers. Here’s how Flake’s H-2C legislation attempts to address several of these concerns:H-2C workers would be initially admitted for up to three years. The visa could be renewed, but only within the confines of the 10-year pilot program. Once in the United States, H-2C workers could be promoted and would be allowed to move to another registered employer with open positions. They would not be allowed to bring family members to the United States.The Willing Workers and Willing Employers Act would create a flexible cap, beginning with 65,000 in the first year and ranging from 45,000 to 85,000 in subsequent years, to match labor market demand. According to Flake, “this kind of flexible, market-based visa program designed to better meet economic demand is exactly the approach we need to bring U.S.-immigration policy into the 21st century.”Groups including the American Health Care Association, the National Turkey Federation, and the National Association of Home Builders have praised the bill for advancing the national immigration conversation and for taking steps towards easing worker shortages. However, the bill does not address many of the shortcomings in existing temporary worker programs, does not address undocumented immigrant workers already in the country, and does not resolve numerous other problems with the immigration system.Senator Flake has a long history of working on immigration issues. As a member of the House of Representatives, he worked with fellow Arizonans Jim Kolbe and John McCain to introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation that included a legalization program, an immigrant worker program, and enforcement measures. In 2009, Flake introduced the\xa0Stopping Trained in America PhDs From Leaving the Economy (STAPLE) Act\xa0 (H.R. 1791) which would have authorized students who earned a Ph.D. in a STEM field from U.S. universities to be admitted for permanent residence. In the Senate, Flake has continued his immigration work and was a member of the Group of Eight which introduced Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 (S.744), which passed in the Senate in 2013.While Flake’s new bill–which is unlikely to move in this Congress–does not purport to resolve all problems with the immigration system, it may serve to renew a constructive conversation on issues surrounding U.S. employers and foreign workers.Photo by Gage Skidmore.Tags:  E-Verify, featured, H-1B, H-2B, H-2C, Jeff FlakeIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'While some politicians on the campaign trail dial-up the anti-immigrant rhetoric and rehash old debates around birthright citizenship and mass deportation, the majority of America is unmoved. According to the Pew Research Center’s recent breakdown of their extensive public polling on immigration, and even more recent Gallup poll data, most of the U.S. public remains committed to practical immigration solutions and believe immigration is good for America.Pew asked Americans of all political persuasions how to resolve the fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. and if mass deportation is a realistic solution. Their polling found that, in May of 2015:“…a solid majority (72%) of Americans – including 80% of Democrats, 76% of independents and 56% of Republicans – say undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay in this country legally if they meet certain requirements. Last year, we asked a follow-up question of those who opposed granting legal status to undocumented immigrants: Should there be a ‘national law enforcement effort to deport’ all immigrants here illegally? Just 17% of the public overall favored such an effort, including about a quarter (27%) of Republicans. Moreover, in a 2013 survey, 76% of Republicans said that deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally was ‘unrealistic.’”With respect to birthright citizenship and efforts to amend the section of the U.S. Constitution that reads “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” Pew found little support, particularly among Hispanics, young people, and Democrats (the groups that made up the coalition that elected President Obama). Pew reports:“…a majority of Americans (57%) in February 2011 said that the Constitution should remain as it is, allowing any child born in the U.S. full citizenship; 39% favored changing the Constitution to bar birthright citizenship…the idea of ending birthright citizenship drew broad opposition among Hispanics (73%), young people (73% of those under 30) and Democrats (66%).”Even more recent Gallup polling done between June and July of this year found that only 19 percent of those surveyed supported mass deportation, while 65 percent supported immigrants staying and becoming citizens while another 14 percent suggested immigrants be allowed to remain and work. The same Gallup poll also found that on the whole 73 percent of respondents believe immigration is a good thing for our country today.Put together, the public polling continues to show that the American public supports immigration and practical, not punitive, solutions for those living without documentation. Many in the political class have caught up with the public; however, a few remain out-of-step with the practical views of the American public.Photo by Scott Cresswell.Tags:  Birthright Citizenship, Election 2016, featured, Gallup, PEW, Public OpinionIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 '\n\t\t\t\tExecutive Orders\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tImmigration\t\t\n\nIssued on:\nJanuary 25, 2017\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation’s immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.Sec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.Sec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.Sec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.Sec. 6. Civil Fines and Penalties. As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.Sec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).Sec. 8. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).(b) To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.Sec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction.Sec. 10. Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies. (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as “Secure Communities” referenced in that memorandum.(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.(c) To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.Sec. 11. Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators. The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.Sec. 12. Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate. The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.Sec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.Sec. 14. Privacy Act. Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order.Sec. 16. Transparency. To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following:(a) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons;(b) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and(c) the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.Sec. 17. Personnel Actions. The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate and lawful action to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.Sec. 18. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

 'The Trump administration on Friday sent nine so-called sanctuary jurisdictions letters demanding they help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing federal grants.“Failure to comply with this condition could result in the withholding of grant funds, suspension or termination of the grant, ineligibility for future [Office of Justice] grants or subgrants, or other action, as appropriate,” acting Assistant Attorney General Alan R. Harten wrote in letters to local officials.Harten’s letter said the jurisdictions must submit documentation showing that they are in compliance with federal law. Sanctuary cities refuse to assist federal agencies with immigration enforcement.\xa0The jurisdictions included New York City, Chicago and the surrounding Cook County, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Miami-Dade County in Florida and the state of California, which were all identified in a May 2016 Justice Department inspector general report as in violation.\xa0The report said the jurisdictions have local rules or regulations that interfere with local law enforcement\'s ability to share information with federal authorities about the immigration status of people in custody.The Justice Department release sent out along with the letter described the sanctuary jurisdictions targeted as "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime."Attorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsThe problem for Trump appointees Juan Williams: The high price of working for Trump Trump\xa0learns to love acting officials MORE last month promised a crackdown on sanctuary cities, saying that Justice Department grants won\'t be provided to them.\xa0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.',
 'For the last 10 years, in federal courts across the Southwest border, the federal government has systematically prosecuted unlawful border crossers in group hearings with little-to-no due process. These prosecutions, often referred to as Operation Streamline, were intended to deter illegal entry and reentry. Instead, they have clogged up the federal courts and wasted precious government resources with little evidence that the program is achieving its goals.Operation Streamline’s ten-year-anniversary will be marked on December 16, 2015. It began in Del Rio, Texas and since that time, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has worked aggressively with local U.S. Attorneys from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prosecute border crossers for illegal entry, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in prison, and illegal re-entry, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. According to Border Patrol estimates, over 279,000 individuals have been referred to DOJ for prosecution from December 2005 to March 2014. These prosecutions are concentrated in border patrol sectors across the Southwest in Arizona and Texas.Immigration status crimes have become the most prosecuted federal crimes in the country with entry and re-entry prosecutions going up 130 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, immigration offenses accounted for half of all federal prosecutions in 2012 with the next highest offense being “drug offenses coming in at only 15 percent.”From its inception, Operation Streamline has been a controversial program. As detailed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, it raises significant due process concerns:“Individuals processed through Streamline appear before a federal magistrate in mass hearings that may have 40 or up to 80 people appearing and entering pleadings at the same time. Nearly all who are charged in such proceedings are unable to consult with their legal counsel within the rapid timeframe and many plead guilty without understanding the consequences. Judges render decisions in a matter of seconds or minutes.”In addition, in May 2015, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report which casts doubt on whether the prosecutions achieve the desired results. It found that Border Patrol is “not fully and accurately measuring Streamline’s effect on deterring” illegal immigration and that CBP targets for prosecution individuals seeking asylum. This practice violates U.S. obligations of the Refugee Convention.Furthermore, the dramatic increase in criminal prosecutions has meant that private prison companies are profiting. In Fiscal Year 2011 alone, “the federal government paid immense sums of taxpayer money to private prison companies, $744 million and $640 million to CCA and GEO Group, respectively.” According to a Grassroots Leadership report, by 2011 Corrections Corporations of America and GEO Group, the nation’s two largest private prison companies, “enjoyed a combined $780 million increase in annual federal revenues since 2005.” The report also notes that since the inception of Operation Streamline until 2012, the federal government spent “$5.5 billion incarcerating undocumented immigrants in the criminal justice system for unauthorized entry and re-entry, above and beyond the civil immigration system.”Although it is difficult to quantify the full costs of prosecuting individuals for illegal entry and reentry, the National Immigration Forum has estimated that in Arizona alone, the costs are as high “as $10 million per month… [A]nother $3.6 million per month is spent on defense lawyers in Arizona, primarily court-appointed private attorneys. The cost to prosecute defendants in Operation Streamline averages $10,000 a day and $50,000 a week in Tucson alone.”As we enter the second decade of Operation Streamline and the final year of the Obama Administration it is time for the Attorney General to heed the call of 171 civil rights, human rights, and faith-based organizations and end this wasteful and unjustified program.Photo by Abd allah Foteih.Tags:  American Civil Liberties Union, American Immigration Lawyers Association, Border Patrol, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Department of Justice, featured, Grassroots Leadership, national immigration forum, operation streamlineIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 '\nImmigration remains the major focus of federal criminal enforcement efforts. The latest available data\nshow that criminal prosecutions for illegal entry, illegal re-entry, and similar immigration violations\nmade up 52 percent of all federal prosecutions in FY 2016. During the 12 months ending September 30,\nimmigration prosecutions totaled 69,636. See Table 1.\n\n\nThis number compares with just 63,405 prosecutions for all other federal crimes—including drugs,\nweapons, fraud, and violations of the thousands of other criminal provisions that the federal\ngovernment is responsible for enforcing.\n\n\nThese comparisons are based on case-by-case records obtained as a result of lengthy litigation brought\nby the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) against the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\nThe number of immigration prosecutions in FY 2016 was down 6.9 percent from levels in FY 2015 when\nsuch prosecutions totaled 74,791. It was also down 15.3 percent from the levels of five years ago when\nthey totaled 82,250. Prosecutions over the past year are still much higher than they were ten years ago.\nOverall, the data show that prosecutions of this type are up 85.6 percent from the level of 37,529\nreported in 2006 and up 823 percent from the level of 7,543 reported in 1996.\n\n\nThe long term trend in immigration prosecutions for these matters going back to FY 1996 is shown more\nclearly in Figure 1. The vertical bars in Figure 1 represent the number of immigration prosecutions of this\ntype recorded each fiscal year. Each presidential administration is distinguished by the color of the bars.\n\n\nThe lead investigative agency for immigration prosecutions through September 2016 \nwas "Homeland Security - Customs  and Border Protection" accounting for 86.9 percent of prosecutions referred.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, additional agencies with substantial numbers of immigration referrals were:  \nHomeland Security - Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (9.7%), "Homeland Security - Citizen and Immigration Services" (2.5%).\nTable 2 shows the top lead charges recorded in the prosecutions of immigration matters \nfiled in U.S. District Court during FY 2016."Entry of alien at improper time or place; etc." (Title 8 U.S.C Section 1325) was the most frequent recorded lead charge.\nTitle 8 U.S.C Section 1325 was ranked 1st a year ago, while it was the 1st most frequently invoked five years ago. It was ranked 2nd ten years ago and 3rd twenty years ago.\nRanked 2nd  in frequency was  the lead charge "Reentry of deported alien" under Title 8 U.S.C Section 1326.\nTitle 8 U.S.C Section 1326 was ranked 2nd a year ago, while it was the 2nd most frequently invoked five years ago. It was ranked 1st ten years ago and 1st twenty years ago.\nRanked 3rd was "Bringing in and harboring certain aliens" under Title 8 U.S.C Section 1324.\nTitle 8 U.S.C Section 1324 was ranked 3rd a year ago, while it was the 3rd most frequently invoked five years ago. It was ranked 3rd ten years ago and 2nd twenty years ago.\nAgain among the top ten lead charges, the one showing the sharpest \n decline in prosecutions compared to one year ago—down 35 \xa0percent—was \n"False statement in application and use of passport " (Title 18  U.S.C Section 1542 ).\nThis was the same statute that had the largest  decrease—76%—when compared with five years ago. \n\n\nUnderstandably, there is great variation in the number of immigration \nprosecutions in each of the nation\'s ninety-four federal judicial districts. \nThe districts registering the largest number of prosecutions of this type during \n FY 2016 are shown in Table 3. \nThe Southern District of Texas (Houston)—with 24,549 prosecutions—was the most active through September 2016.\nThe Southern District of Texas (Houston) was ranked 1st a year ago, while it was ranked 2nd five years ago.

 'Among the executive actions on immigration unveiled last November was the announcement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would end the controversial Secure Communities program and replace it with the new Priority Enforcement Program (PEP). After months of planning, DHS officially launched PEP last month. The agency has begun a full court press on implementation, attempting to enroll states and locals into the program. However as the Washington Post reports, DHS faces significant challenges in bringing local law enforcement agencies and governments into the fold.PEP began with a memo issued on November 20, 2014 by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, in which he seemingly acknowledges some of Secure Communities’ shortcomings and recognizes the need to end it. In its place, he announced the launch of PEP, a program that purports to focus efforts on apprehending individuals actually convicted of specified crimes. In theory, this makes it less of a dragnet than the previous program. PEP also reportedly allows locals to design how they will participate.The memo states:“I am directing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to discontinue Secure Communities. ICE should put in its place a program that will continue to rely on fingerprint-based biometric data submitted during bookings by state and local law enforcement agencies to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks. However, ICE should only seek the transfer of an alien in the custody of state or local law enforcement through the new program when the alien has been convicted of an offense listed in Priority 1 (a), (c), (d), and (e) and Priority 2 (a) and (b) of the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants Memorandum, or when, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, the alien otherwise poses a danger to national security. In other words, unless the alien poses a demonstrable risk to national security, enforcement actions through the new program will only be taken against aliens who are convicted of specifically enumerated crimes.”By the time Johnson issued this memo, many communities already had pushed back against Secure Communities. More than 300 communities adopted community trust policies limiting collaboration with ICE and have declined to honor ICE detainers. Most locals cited the serious consequences on community policing, constitutional defects in the detainers ICE issued, and civils rights violations that arose as a consequence of Secure Communities’ broad dragnet.These concerns about Secure Communities remain relevant to local law enforcement agencies and governments trying to decide how to respond to PEP. According to the Washington Post:“While DHS says more than 30 of the nation’s largest law enforcement agencies have indicated a willingness to work with the agency on PEP, few have publicly said they will participate. The city of Los Angeles told The Washington Post that its police department, the nation’s third largest, will not, though Los Angeles County is participating. Other jurisdictions — such as Philadelphia, with the fourth-largest police force — are wrestling with the issue at a time of changing demographics.”Even DHS officials recognize the challenge ahead. The Post quotes one official:“A large part of the skepticism comes from just a poor track record with Secure Communities,’’ said one DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings with local officials about PEP. “There’s a trust deficit here that has to be overcome.’’As the program continues to be rolled out by DHS, they are likely to face fierce resistance from many communities around the country. Their resistance is born out of experience. The local communities, where people live and work, face the real life consequences of immigration enforcement when workers, parents and community members are targeted for immigration enforcement actions. Locals have made clear that they will be the ones to decide how to balance community policing with cooperation with immigration enforcement.Photo by Gage Skidmore.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, executive action, featured, Jeh Johnson, Priority Enforcement Program, secure communitiesIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 'No redactions here: Read Trump\'s written responses in the Mueller reportA six-year-old enforcement tool that links people booked into local jails with federal immigration authorities is getting the ax as part of President Barack Obama’s immigration reforms.Under the multi-million-dollar Secure Communities program, local authorities shared digital fingerprints from everyone booked into jail with federal authorities, who combed the prints for immigrants, those here legally and illegally, so they could be deported.As more and more immigrants who had committed traffic or immigration violations were nabbed by local officials and turned over to immigration authorities, the program began to drive a wedge between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.“Its very name has become a symbol of hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws,” acknowledged Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in a memo detailing the administration\'s decision.Immigrants and civil rights groups as well as some local police officials said Secure Communities made policing more difficult because immigrants fearful or resentful of the cooperation with federal immigration authorities would not come forward to report crimes or assist with information or witness accounts that might be helpful in investigations.Johnson noted that governors, mayors and state and local law enforcement officers refused to cooperate with the program and that many federal courts rejected local law enforcement’s authority to detain immigrants under the program.Though the overarching goal of Secure Communities remained valid, stated Johnson, "a fresh start and a new program are necessary."The memo drew responses by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. advocacy and policy counsel Jon Blazer. “We agree with Secretary Johnson’s conclusion that the program has failed to support community policing and has destroyed trust between local and law enforcement officials and DHS and immigrant communities and local police,” Blazer said.Secure Communities began as a pilot program under President George W. Bush, but was greatly expanded by Obama’s former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.It also had been controversial because while it was initially pitched as a program that local authorities could participate in voluntarily, it was soon made mandatory, even though federal officials knew early on they would get local resistance. The program became a catalyst for protests of Obama as deportations under his administration grew.In recent years, cities and local sheriffs had increasingly pulled away from the program by refusing to detain some of the immigrants who had been arrested on lower-level infractions, such as trespassing or failing to stop at a stop sign.The Pew Charitable Trusts found that nearly 300 cities and counties as well as the states of California, Colorado and Connecticut had stopped or curtailed cooperation.But not everyone disagrees with the program. Some local officials, such as the Travis County Sheriff’s Office in Austin, Texas, have been supporters of the program.Secure Communities is to be replaced with what the administration is calling the Priority Enforcement Program.As part of the president’s executive action immigration reforms, Johnson is rewriting the rules that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses to decide who is a priority for deportation. The aim is to ensure tax dollars and other resources go to removing the most dangerous and law-breaking immigrants in the country.Homeland Security will still check electronic fingerprints of people booked by local officials, but will focus on immigrants who fit the profile of those that are at the top of the list for deportation and will work with the Department of Justice to deport federal criminals who are imprisoned, the White House said.Rather than asking for a local official to hold a person longer than they would usually be held, ICE must ask to be notified of pending release of immigrants they have in custody.“If local and state law enforcement picks up someone who is consistent with our priorities, they will notify DHS and because they are a priority, agents will come to remove them,” a senior administration official told reporter in a briefing before the president’s speech on the condition the official was not identified.“If they are not consistent (with the priorities), agents will be notified, but they will not come forward to remove that person and after will be released from state custody according to state law,” the official said.Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports limited immigration, said DHS already doesn’t show up for immigrants who have been picked up for low-level crimes so “I don’t know what that means as far as ending Secure Communities.”“What they are saying is they are going to ignore people who come to our attention via Secure Communities,” Krikorian said. He said it is bad policing to go without the program because ICE repeatedly has passed on immigrants illegally in the country who went on to commit serious offenses.Obama tried to emphasize that his administration remains focused on enforcement in his speech. “Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe they must be held accountable, especially those who may be dangerous,” Obama said.That’s why the focus will be on “felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who’s working hard to provide for her kids,” Obama said. “We’ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.”© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL',
 'Our American values and laws dictate that everyone receive a just and fair process, whether they have been in in this country for decades or are arriving at our border today in search of safety and protection.Today, President Trump signed two executive orders on immigration that seek to shut America’s doors and label immigrants as invaders and criminals.The “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvement” executive order is an attempt to fulfill his campaign pledge to build a wall at the southern border, to provide additional resources to Border Patrol agents, to curtail due process at the border, and to increase detention along the southern border, including for those who are seeking protection. It also encourages expanded collaboration with state and local law enforcement to act as immigration agents. Much of what is contained in this order would require vast amounts of funding and additional appropriations from Congress.The “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” executive order will ramp up interior enforcement by dramatically expanding the enforcement priorities to include anyone who committed an act that could be considered a crime, no matter how small. The order also \xa0includes a revival of the problematic Secure Communities program (which was ended under the Obama Administration), orders the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider stripping federal funding from so-called Sanctuary Cities, and encourages additional criminal prosecutions of immigrants for illegal entry.Over the next few weeks and months, we expect the President’s cabinet and agency staff to begin implementing the directives in the orders and issuing additional orders that adversely impact refugees and nationals of Muslim-majority countries.These executive orders double down on an enforcement-only approach, a costly, ineffective, and mean-spirited strategy that runs counter to our American tradition of welcoming immigrants.Immigrants strengthen America by bringing skills, talents and new energy to our economy and most Americans believe in a welcoming and inclusive America, one where all individuals are treated with respect and fairness, no matter where they were born or how they arrived in this country.Our nation needs a practical and efficient immigration policy that honors immigrants’ contributions, fuels our economy, protects families, and benefits all Americans.Tags:  Donald Trump, Executive Actions on Immigration, featuredIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.

 '\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a new office for Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) on April 26, declaring that its “singular mission is to support victims of crime through access to information and resources.” Originally proposed in the Trump administration’s interior enforcement executive order, the office seeks to be a “programmatic liaison between [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ICE and the known victims of crime committed by removable aliens,” and will ensure that victims are provided information about the offender such as immigration and custody status.According to DHS, the key objectives of the VOICE office are to acknowledge and support victims and their families; promote awareness of the services that are available; build partnerships with victims’ assistance groups; and provide quarterly reports studying the effects of victimization by immigrants.But immigrant advocates see a different objective. “This really isn’t about helping victims,” said Brent Wilkes, chief executive of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). “It’s really about trying to vilify the immigrant population in this country and using that to their political advantage.”Though the role of the office may evolve over time, it appears that VOICE will currently operate a hotline that can connect victims to social service professionals and give them access to automated information about the custody status of the immigrant who committed the crime.Through a Victim Information Notification Exchange (VINE) system, VOICE can help people who have been affected by crimes committed by an immigrant and track the ICE custody status of the individual perpetrator. As a result of the VINE system—which was initiated under the previous administration—attorneys and others can now also register to be automatically notified of a detainee’s “custody status changes,” such as when individuals are taken into custody, transferred, released, or deported.It is unclear how much information ICE will be able to give to victims or attorneys due to privacy protections. Although ICE has said that they will not ask about a victim’s immigration status when a person calls VOICE, immigrant communities are understandably apprehensive about how the information they provide could be used against them or their families.ICE currently has 21 community relations officers who will assume the responsibilities of the VOICE office. However, victim advocates are concerned that the skill set required to perform a community relations function is quite distinct from the specialized skills needed to work with victims of crime and trauma.These concerns about whether victims will remain safe and meaningfully served if they reach out to ICE are especially heightened following recent, unprecedented immigration enforcement actions.Advocates point to the recent arrest of a domestic violence victim at a courthouse and a growing reluctance to report sexual assaults out of fear of triggering deportation as evidence that this office may exacerbate tensions, not minimize them.While there is no doubt that any victim of crime deserves acknowledgement and sympathy, this administration’s emphasis on victims of immigrant crime is problematic.The data clearly show that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely than native born Americans to commit crimes. This office is not only unnecessary but will likely be used to garner flashy headlines and push an anti-immigrant agenda.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, featured, John Kelly, Sanctuary Cities, Victims of Immigration Crime EngagementIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.
